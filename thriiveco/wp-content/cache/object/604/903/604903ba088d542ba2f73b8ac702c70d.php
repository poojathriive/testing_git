Commonly called the flu, influenza is not the same as the flu virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea.¬† According to WHO, the annual cases of severe influenza is around 3 to 5 million with about 650,000 death cases.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In developed communities, most influenza death occurs among older adults of not less than 65 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although most cases of influenza are resolved on their own, the condition may be deadly.</span>

<b>What Does Influenza Look Like?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The flu usually starts as sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat. Other signs include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue</span></li>

 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sore throat</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasal congestion</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Preventing Influenza with vaccination</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Health regulatory boards recommend annual flu vaccination for children of 6 months and older.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The injection or nasal spray vaccination protects against the four common types of influenza virus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the vaccination does not provide total protection against the complication, certain lifestyle measures can be taken to reduce its spread:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><b>Thoroughly wash your hands</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your hand clean by frequently washing them is one of the potentially effective ways to prevent everyday infections including influenza virus. If soap and water aren't available, you can use alcohol-containing sanitizer.</span>

<b>Cough and sneeze healthily</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep your nose and mouth covered whenever you cough or sneeze to prevent infection through hands.¬† Sneeze or cough into a tissue/handkerchief to avoid spreading the infection.</span>

<b>Stay away from crowds</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Flu can easily spread in places congested with people - in banking halls, large office buildings, schools, community meetings, public transportation, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By avoiding crowded environment, you can reduce the risk of infection. And if you're battling with fever, stay indoors for up to 24 hours so you can lessen the risk of infecting others.</span>

<b>Dietary approach to preventing influenza</b>

<b>Add protein, zinc to the diet: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein-rich foods contain essential minerals like zinc which produces white blood cells that fight disease-causing pathogens.</span>

<b>Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruits and vegetables, most importantly those containing vitamin A and C are rich in antioxidants and strengthen the immune system. Examples of them include carrots, mango, and sweet potato. Other good options include kiwi, broccoli, and strawberries.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†According to her, the main cause of Influenza is: </span><b>Response to mass negativity and beliefs. Fear. Belief in statistics.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Influenza is: </span><b>I allow my mind to relax and be at peace. Clarity and harmony are within me and all around me</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
