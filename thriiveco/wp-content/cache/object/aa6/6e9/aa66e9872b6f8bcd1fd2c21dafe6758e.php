Experiencing occasional anxiety is normal, and just your bodies reaction to fear in regular life situations--like the first day at a new job of school. But when anxiety is persistent and comes up in daily life, seriously hampering day to day activities it is an Anxiety Disorder. As per WHO (World Health Organization) 1 in 13 people suffer from an anxiety disorder, making it one of the most common mental illnesses. Children and teenagers under 21 are often prone to anxiety. Only ‚Öì of the people that are suffering from this disease recieve treatment, although it‚Äôs easily curable.

<strong>Overcoming Anxiety Disorders</strong>

Whenever you become anxious or stressed, you induce a flood of the stress hormone cortisol and its consistent presence could damage parts of the brain that process memory and executive functioning. Getting relief for anxiety disorders is then imperative.

One of the first measures in Anxiety management is Medication. Another important and much neglected therapy that can help is Talk therapy. Talking about one‚Äôs condition openly to a qualified therapist can help to find the right solutions. Lifestyle changes are known to help: getting enough sleep and exercise is seen to bring about beneficial effects. But one must keep away from alcohol, caffeine and other mood-altering substances as they are known to have a negative impact.

<strong>Food can be medicinal. Given below are some foods that can boost brain health and reduce anxiety:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>chamomile</li>
 	<li>turmeric</li>
 	<li>dark chocolate</li>
 	<li>yogurt</li>
 	<li>green tea</li>
</ul>
<strong>Going beyond the holistic approach</strong>

Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Anxiety Disorders by way of curing the disease but not its roots. Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù According to her, the main cause of anxiety is: Not trusting the flow and the process of life. This lack of faith manifests in our bodies as anxiety. One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.

Her affirmation for healing Anxiety Disorders is: <em><strong>I love and approve of myself and I trust in the process of life. I am safe.</strong></em>
