The floor Mandana is based on 'Panchmahabhuta' - five elements of universal 'Prakriti'-The Mother Nature. Mandana is derived from the Sanskrit word â€˜Mandanâ€™ which means 'to invent'. This art form is drawn to get the blessings of God and shows respect towards the nature, agriculture, animate beings such as animals, small creatures, birds, tree and plants and inanimate beings. This is the only such folk art of India which is based on Spirituality and is being revived by Shri Lakhi Chand Jain. It is a wordless form of art therapy that helps the individual to access one's inner core of creative energy.
