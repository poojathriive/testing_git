The practitioner combines healing energy with voice and movement. It establishes a constant flow of energy from the heart to the Source, the All That Is, through all of the spiritual centers down to the diamond at the center of the Earth. The practitioner places one hand in front of the body and the other at the back of the client who is receiving the healing.
