It works on neurological signal pathways that arenâ€™t functioning optimally. It actively participates with the brain in establishing corrective healing patterns by establishing a two-way communication with the brain to help it correct the erratic holding pattern and trigger another system in the body to send the rebalancing chemicals and hormones. In this way it helps to restore lost bodily functions and trigger tissue regeneration. It is also used as a device to slow down ageing.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1517";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"2";}}
