It involves the placing of hot cups- made up of either silicone or plastic on the affected area. As the air inside the cup cools down, it creates a vacuum and a suction force that makes the blood vessels in that region expand, thereby improving blood circulation in the affected area and reducing muscle tension.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1475";s:5:"count";s:1:"4";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"4";}}
