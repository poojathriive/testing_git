Yes, it is a neurological disorder characterised by pain that is restricted to one side of the head, could be throbbing or pulsing, lasting for up to 4 hours or even days at a stretch, despite pain relief measures. </span>

<b>The headache can be often accompanied by:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nausea, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vomiting, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">difficulty speaking, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">numbness or tingling, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sensitivity to light and sound and </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It is also possible to have these symptoms without any headache. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on symptoms and clinical history, migraines are categorised into those </span><b>with aura </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(classic migraines) and those </span><b>without aura </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(common migraines).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a study conducted in Eastern India, the results showed that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 14.12% of the respondents had migraine. The maximum burden was among women aged between 30 and 34 years.</span>

<b>Causes of Migraine</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No definite cause(s) have been identified for migraines but triggers are many. Changes in brain chemicals, e.g. decrease in the level of serotonin can activate a migraine. </span>

<b>Other triggers include:</b>

<b>Emotional factors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress, anxiety, depression, trauma</span>

<b>Diet: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobacco,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">caffeine or caffeine withdrawal, skipped meals, alcohol, chocolate, aged cheeses, Monosodium glutamate (MSG), fermented or pickled goods, yeast, cured meats, some fruits and nuts, dehydration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Sensory overload:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Strong smells, loud noises, bright or flashing lights, sudden changes in weather</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Physical conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often), too much or not enough sleep, hormonal changes in women, Overexertion (too much physical activity), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">low blood sugar and jet lag.</span>

<b>Managing Migraines</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migraine sufferers wish they could pop a pill and get immediate relief from the debilitation that a migraine can cause. But since that is not a thing, the next best course of action is prevention. The frequency of a migraine attack </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be controlled by adopting these measures in oneâ€™s lifestyle: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting enough sleep</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing stress</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drinking plenty of water</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoiding certain foods</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular physical exercise</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping a migraine log to see what foods, medicines or activities trigger the migraine</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gluten-free diet can be helpful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no cure for migraines but Â doing these things can help to alleviate the discomfort:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Drinking fluids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Going beyond the holistic approach</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Migraines. Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€ According to her, the main cause of </span><b>Migraine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is</span><b>: Dislike of being driven. Resisting the flow of life. Sexual fears. Â Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Migraine is</span><b>: </b><b>Â Â I relax into the flow of life and let life provide all that I need easily and comfortably. I love Life! </b><b><i>
