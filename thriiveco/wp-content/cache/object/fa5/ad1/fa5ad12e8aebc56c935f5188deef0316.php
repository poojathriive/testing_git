<span style="font-weight: 400;">To explain what OCD is, letâ€™s take this example: We have a lock system in our cars that rings an alarm each time somebody breaks it open. Remember this lock system is your mind. Now imagine the lock system is spoilt and sets off alarms in a sporadic interval. Each time it rings, you may go and check it over and over again, eventually after a point you realize it is the spoilt lock system and you calm down. But for those people with OCD, they know the alarm is spoilt but still find the need to check the car over and over again because it causes immense anxiety.Â </span>

<b>These are some symptoms to watch out for:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Repetitive obsessions and intrusive, fearful thoughts.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Recurrent, disturbing mental images.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Compulsions like aligning things at home over and over again (to control the anxiety).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents must be watchful if their children, especially between 7-12 years of age, exhibit such symptoms.</span>

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing with a lot of psychiatric illness is that you cannot pinpoint one cause and say what has caused them. However, those with a family history of OCD could be more prone to it than others.</span>

<b>Foods to eat</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is believed that a lot of ailments could be cured by eating right. For those suffering from OCD, it is advised to have foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids like chia seeds, walnuts and low-fat dairy products like low-fat milk etc.</span>

<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">OCD doesnâ€™t have a definitive cure, however, it can be treated through medication and various therapies like family therapy, behavioural therapy and so on.Â </span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative therapies that could help in curing OCD include Reiki, Dr. Bach flower remedies, Pranic healing, Acupressure, Energy healing.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}}
