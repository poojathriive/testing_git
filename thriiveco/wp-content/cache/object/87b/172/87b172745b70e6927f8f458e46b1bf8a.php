This infection spreads rapidly and it is believed that once you have survived the disease, there are very less chances that you would ever acquire it again. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">World Health Organization (WHO) stated, â€œMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.â€</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Câ€™s characterize the symptoms of measles: Cough, corzya (runny nose) and conjunctivitis. One of these three will surely be very prominent in case of anyone suffering from the disease. Symptoms of the disease generally occur about 10 days after the initial infection.</span>

</ul>
<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The WHO states, â€œSevere measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. A weak immune system is the one-point cause of the infection. The virus remains active for 2 hours on any object. It spreads through:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact with an infected person.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhaling the sneeze or cough droplets of someone with an infection.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking near an infected person could make it worse for the person. </span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you have developed another health condition because of measles, your doctor will not give you any medication. Dehydration, is the most common ailment that occurs as a result of measles. Therefore, having plenty of healthy fluids and water is your first line of defense against the illness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cough medicines and medicines to treat the underlying causes could be extremely helpful too. Vitamin A supplements are commonly given to someone who suffers from such an infection.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
