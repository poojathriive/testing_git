<b>Causes Of Crohn's Disease</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real cause of this disease remains a mystery. At first, stress and diet were linked to it, but lately, doctors only think these factors may only trigger but won‚Äôt lead to Crohn's disease.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some factors like hereditary play a major role in the disease.</span>

<b>Risk Factors Of Crohn's Disease</b>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This inflammatory bowel disease occurs at any age, but it's more prevalent in young people. The age of most people diagnosed with Crohn's disease is less than 30 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><b>Ethnicity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Crohn's disease affects people from various ethnic groups, whites and Jewish descent have a higher risk.</span>

<b>Family history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your family or a close relative has once dealt with issues of Crohn's disease, chances are you will be affected.</span>

<b>Smoking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking, especially cigarettes, is one of the biggest risk factors of developing this inflammatory bowel disease. It can lead to serious Crohn's disease so it‚Äôs better to quit smoking.</span>

<b>Location: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who live in an urban area or in an industrialized location may likely develop Crohn's disease.</span>

<b>Treatment Of Crohn's Disease</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medically, there is no cure for Crohn's disease. The aim of medical treatment is to lower the inflammation that causes the symptoms.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Crohn's disease is: </span><b>Fear. Worry. Not feeling good enough.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Crohn's disease is: </span><b>I digest and assimilate all new experiences peacefully and joyously. I am enough.</b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
