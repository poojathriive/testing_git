Prenatal Yoga consists of yoga poses tailor-made for pregnant women. If practiced regularly, it can  help increase strength and flexibility and reduce the risk of preterm labor. It can also soothe the immense discomfort that women face during pregnancy due to nausea, stress, lower back pain, sleeplessness and headaches. Prenatal yoga is not only helpful for the mother, but also protects the baby from the risk of intrauterine growth restriction, a condition that can slow the babyâ€™s growth.
