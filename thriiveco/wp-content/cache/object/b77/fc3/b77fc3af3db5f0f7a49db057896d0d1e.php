Globally, the main reason Goitre develops is because of lack of iodine in the body. Most Goitre does not come with sign and symptoms. But it can cause the following:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A noticeable swelling of the neck region</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tight feeling around the throat</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoarseness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coughing</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† ¬† ¬† Difficulty in breathing and swallowing¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Goitre occurs due to the expansion of the thyroid gland. Certain factors can lead to this expansion, among them are:</span>

<b>Iodine deficiency</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although insufficient iodine in the body is the main source of Goitre, however, this isn't the case in countries where iodine is routinely added to their salts. It can affect anyone irrespective of the sex or age (although it's slightly prevalent among middle-aged adults and females).</span>

<b>Dealing With Hypothyroidism (The Medical Term For Goitre)</b>

<b>Regular exercise</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercising is an imperative method of dealing with Goitre. Yoga and other regular exercise can help burn calories and prevent Goitre development.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a 45-minute walk also maintains your heart health and keeps your cholesterol level in check.</span>

<b>Low protein diet</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating a diet rich in fat and low in protein and sugar in a diet plan is a significant way of preventing Goitre. It's also important to steer clear of junk and processed food. Regularly eating foods rich in iodine and vitamin is a good routine diet to incorporate as well. Those suffering from Goitre should avoid eating cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, garbage, and cauliflower.</span>

<b>Drink plenty of water</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking a good amount of water keeps the body temperature under control and hydrates the skin. Goitre patients are advised to drink not less than 8 glasses of water a day.</span>

<b>Stop smoking and drinking alcohol</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They are both harmful and can improve the chances of having Goitre.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Goitre is: </span><b>Humiliation. I never get to do what I want to do. When is it going to be my turn¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Goitre is: </span><b>It is in flexibility I see</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
