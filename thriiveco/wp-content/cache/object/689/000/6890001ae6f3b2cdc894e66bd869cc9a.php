CBT is based on the idea that thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, behaviours and actions are all interconnected. And that by consciously changing a single component of this vicious cycle, all aspects can be improved for a better life. It is most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems as well.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1539";s:5:"count";s:2:"20";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:2:"20";}}
