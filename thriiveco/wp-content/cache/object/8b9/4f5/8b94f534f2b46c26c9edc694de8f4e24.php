In this meditation, one has to be completely conscious, alert and continuously aware of every action. It is a specific technique that lasts for an hour, including a sequence of 5 steps: breathing, catharsis (expressing yourself in whichever way you find comfortable), chanting the mantra â€˜Hooâ€™, being still and celebrating in the form of dance. The meditation provides benefits of inner peace, silence, better attention, concentration, calming influence, stress management and freedom from addiction.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1491";s:5:"count";s:2:"31";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"4";}}
