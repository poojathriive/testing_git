It is usually caused by mental damage or abnormal growth of the brain which mostly occurs before birth. It is very important to take care of yourself in this fast-paced environment and maintaining a routine never hurts. Though what happens is not in our hands, we can always take care of what is.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The signs of Cerebral Palsy become visible during infancy or early school years of a child. It can lead to abnormal bone development and posture of the body, creating floppiness or rigidity of the limbs. Less control over facial muscles, speech impairment and difficulties in swallowing and feeding are some of the symptoms seen in such cases. It is treatable to an extent but there is no cure.Â </span>

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main cause cannot be exactly determined in most cases but a few factors are listed below</span><b>:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Genetic Mutations</b></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Maternal infections</b></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Infant infections</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pertaining to the brain</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Traumatic head injury</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in childhood</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Complications during delivery</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it is difficult to prevent cerebral palsy, you can lessen the risks by taking care of the following in your pregnancy &amp; post pregnancy period:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Make sure you're vaccinated.</b></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Take care of yourself</b></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Seek early and continuous prenatal care</b></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Practice good child safety</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Foods to eat</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids with CP lack proper coordination to feed themselves, chew and sometimes even swallow the food without choking.Â  Mealtimes can be made less challenging with proper techniques. A trained nutritionist can provide the proper guidance to make sure the child with CP receives nutrients and supplements based on their lifestyle activities. Special care needs to be taken especially in the case of calcium and Vit. D deficiencies.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the cause of Cerebral palsy is: </span><b>A need to unite the family in an action to love.Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing for Cerebral Palsy is</span><b><i>: </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></i><b>I contribute to a united, loving, and peaceful family life. All is well.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other alternative therapies that have also given good results for treating this disorder are Hippotherapy, Acupuncture, Music Therapy, Aquatic therapy, Biofeedback training, Reiki, Spiritual Counseling &amp; Emotional Freedom Technique.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
