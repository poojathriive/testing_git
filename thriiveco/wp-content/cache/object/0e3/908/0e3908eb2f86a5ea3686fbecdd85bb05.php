RFI involves the use of small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip is capable of carrying around 2000 bytes of data. The RFID device serves the same purpose as a bar code or a magnetic strip on the back of an ATM card â€“ it provides a unique identifier for that object. And, just as a barcode or magnetic strip must be scanned to get the information, the RFID device scans the body to retrieve identifying information such as Aura and Chakra Analysis, Brainwave Analysis, Organ level analysis, Vaastu (Objects and Spaces) Analysis and Botanical Analysis (Plants and Trees). It also finds much use in studying the behaviour of animals and in paranormal investigations.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1503";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"1";}}
