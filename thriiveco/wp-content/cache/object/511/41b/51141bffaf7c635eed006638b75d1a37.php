<span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin infections are itchy, irritating and usually leave scars on your skin. Scabies is one such infection that is caused by an eight-legged bug. This bug, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is commonly known as the â€˜human itch miteâ€™ cannot be seen by the naked eye. It burrows into the skin and leads to developing an itchy rash.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the mite travels from one infected person to another. This could be due to skin-to-skin contact, sexual contact or due to the sharing of infected clothes, furniture or bedding. The mite survives for about 4 days without coming in contact with a human. This is quite a common skin condition across the globe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, â€œScabies infestation is frequently complicated by bacterial infection, leading to the development of skin sores that, in turn, can cause more serious consequences such as septicaemia, heart disease and chronic kidney disease.â€</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The scabies infection takes about 2-6 weeks to show visibly on your skin. Here are signs you must watch out for:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Incessant itching, especially at night time.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Getting the scabies rash.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Sores.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Formation of crusts on the skin.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scabies can develop anywhere on the skin but the most common places theyâ€™re likely to develop in are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Hands</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Arms</span></li>

</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most dermatologists opt for a mix of antibiotics and lotions to treat the skin condition. However, since skin conditions take a little longer to develop, they also take as long to subside. Ointments, herbal pastes (recommended by experts) as well as antibiotics can be quite useful.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of scabies disease is: </span><b>Infected thinking. Allowing others to get under your skin.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating scabies is</span><b>: I am the living, loving, joyous expression of life. I am my own person.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some herbs or home remedies have also been quite fruitful in treating the health condition. Alternative treatments like using tea tree oil, neem creams, aloe vera, turmeric, clove oil have proven effects</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
