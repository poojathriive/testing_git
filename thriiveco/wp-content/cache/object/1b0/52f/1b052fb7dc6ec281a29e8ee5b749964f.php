It is believed that dolphins have incarnated on Earth to help heal the energy of the planet and humans. One doesnâ€™t have to swim with dolphins to receive these healing energies; in fact practitioners who can connect with dolphins can send the energy of dolphins either in person or through a distant healing session.
