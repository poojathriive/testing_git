<b>Â Tips For Preventing Dermatitis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding dry skin is one of the most effective steps to take in order to prevent dermatitis. The following tips will help reduce the common drying effects on the skin:</span>

<b>Take a shorter bath: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce your bath period to less than 10 minutes. Preferably, bath with warm water and apply bath oil (if available)</span>

<b>Use gentle soaps: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a mild soap or fragrance-free non-soap cleanser. Carefully select your soap, because some may dry the skin.</span>

<b>Carefully dry your body: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a bath, carefully brush your skin using your palm, or pat-dry your skin using a very soft towel.</span>

<b>Moisturize your skin: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gently apply cream or oil on your damp skin. Carefully select a moisturizer that works for you.</span>

<b>Dietary And Lifestyle Changes To Manage Dermatitis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Treating different types of dermatitis requires patience, consistency, and a combination of the right therapies. But itâ€™s definitely important to eat a healthy and balanced diet.
