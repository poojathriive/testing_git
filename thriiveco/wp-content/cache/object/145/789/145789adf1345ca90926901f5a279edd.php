They can occur anywhere in the body and do vary in sizes. They cause chronic pain. Abnormal lumps in any part of the body could be an indicator of the presence of a cyst. Cysts could occur anywhere in the body.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many </span><b>types</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of cysts:</span>

 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Ovarian cysts</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a common notion that only women suffer from cysts, but that isnâ€™t true. Some kinds of cysts, do occur specifically among women. While some, like sebaceous cysts or simple renal cysts can occur in both genders.Â </span>

<b>Cysts can be caused due to a variety of factors, namely:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Genetics</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Infections</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Cellular defects</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Blockages of ducts in the body</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Chronic inflammatory conditions</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Tumours</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of cysts have no symptoms or signs unless the cyst has progressed and grown in size. Some kinds of cysts that appear on the skin are detectable, while most of them, which grow in the internal organs donâ€™t show signs at all- unless they are extremely painful and large in size.</span>

<b>Foods to eat</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Antioxidant-rich foods: Go for vegetables and fruits of all colours and variety. Make them a part of your routine diet. Also make sure to relish dark chocolate.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Foods rich in fatty acids: Gorge on chia seeds, walnuts, flax seeds and so on.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Consume iron-rich foods like nuts, beans, fortified grains and green leafy vegetables.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A medical treatment for cyst will depend on a variety of factors such as the type of cyst, its size, its location and most importantly, how painful/ severe it is. If it is large and needs immediate attention, a surgical removal of the cyst may be necessary. If the location of the cyst is not easily reachable or is not that severe and can be drained out of the body through medication or injection, that is also an option.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her,Â  cysts are caused due to: </span><b>Running the old painful movie in your head. A constant false growth in your body.Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating cysts is: </span><b>The movies of my mind are beautiful because I choose to make them so. I love me.</b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
