<b>Preventing IBS</b>

<b>Make a food/symptom journal for a week.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice that a certain food discomforts your body, try removing it from your diet and see if it works.Â  If there is no change in symptoms after some weeks, you can add it back to your diet.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve your digestion:</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat at the right time, every day.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donâ€™t eat too much</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure youâ€™re relaxed before eating</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always chew well before swallowing</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink more fluid and make water your preferred option. For women, 9 cups of water a day is cool. For men, 12 cups a day is ideal.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include more fiber in your diet</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For women, 25g of dietary fiber per day is great, while 38g per day is ideal for men. If you eat too much fiber, reduce it and see if things change. Also, if you eat less of fiber, try increasing it and watching for symptoms.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steer clear of snacks and high-fat meals.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A meal containing excess fat can lead to cramping and diarrhea. Examples of these foods include cream, cheese, fried foods, chocolate, cookies, and regular ground beef.</span>
<ul>
