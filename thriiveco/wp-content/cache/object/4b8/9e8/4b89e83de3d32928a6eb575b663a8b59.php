It is caused by a long-term exposure to substances that irritate the lungs. According to studies, COPD has a prevalence of 251 million cases worldwide in 2016. In fact, in 2018, approximately 3 million deaths were caused by the inflammatory disease with 90% of COPD deaths recorded in third world countries.</span>

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking cigarettes is the leading cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). About 20-30% of hardcore smokers develop COPD while long-term smokers may develop a reduction in lung function.Â  In developing countries, it usually occurs when people inhale fumes from burning fuel.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of COPD are usually detected after significant damage has been done to the lung, which often worsens over time, especially if exposed to more smoke.</span>

<b>Some other conditions that COPD can cause are:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Short breath</span></li>

<b>Risk factors for COPD</b>

<b>Smoking tobacco</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As aforementioned, the most common risk factor for COPD is smoking. The more the smoke the higher your risk of COPD.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asthma patients who smoke</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asthma combined with smoking triggers your risk of COPD.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to dust and chemical fumes</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to all these can inflame and irritate your lungs.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Keeping A Healthy Lung With The Best Diet</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often times, we care less for our lungs. But they help us stay alive. Thatâ€™s why we must prioritize their health. Although the body has natural defense systems which protect the lungs, there are certain diets that must be included in order to reduce the risk of COPD.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research, people who consumed a high-fat, low-carb supplement showed improvement than those who took high-carb diets. Also, try to include the following into your daily diet:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein-rich foodsÂ </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include complex carbohydrates because they are high in fiber.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foods to add to your diets include peas, quinoa, beans, bran, potatoes with skin, lentils, oats, barley.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruits and vegetables contain minerals, vitamins, and fibers.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium-rich foods such as avocado, tomatoes, beets, oranges, bananas.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Preventing COPD</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">COPD can be prevented. Most cases have been linked to smoking, so the best way to prevent it is to quit smoking. Sure, this simple statement may not look simple if youâ€™re a hardcore smoker, but you can quit. Itâ€™s all about trying.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People working in environments exposed to dust and chemical fumes are also at higher risk. If you work in this type of environment, look for protective, respiratory equipment to protect yourself.</span>

<b>Going beyond the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of COPD is: </span><b>Fear. Not trusting the process of life. Getting stuck in childhood. Fear of taking in life fully.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing COPD is: </span><b>I have the capacity to take in the fullness of life. I lovingly live life to the fullness.Â </b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}}
