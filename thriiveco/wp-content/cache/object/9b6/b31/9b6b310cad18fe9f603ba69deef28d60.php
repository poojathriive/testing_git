A body of knowledge, philosophy and practice it aims to increase the wellbeing of an individual and the collective/ group. It functions through a tri-pronged approach: of self-reflexivity, using groups as a source of experience & insights, and acting upon these insights.

Based on the Samkhya philosophy of self-analysis, Process Work helps to release energy and channels blocked by feeling caused in everyday
living; both in the present moment and residual. Process work is empowering as it guides the individual to find the solution for their problems within their own self.
