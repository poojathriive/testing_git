<h1 class="font_2" style="text-align: center;">10 Steps ToÂ Natural Glow</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Take The Masterclass To Discover A Make-Up &amp; Maintenance Free Lifestyle</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="padding: 10px 10px; text-align: justify;">At 28, I looked haggard, tired and had prominent eye bags â€“ yes, the picture of me from 2009 is with make up.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">I had a leaky gut, insomnia and regular 18-hour migraines as well. Over-analyzing, asking myself at 4 PM â€“ â€˜will I get sleep tonight?â€™ was a common phenomenon. I did not like myself without make up and needed it to feel confident. It does sound exhausting right?</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">And one day I gave it up! I was compelled to slowly find all solutions inside me â€“ for my skin, my mind, my sleep, my gut. I was more willing to take this challenge up than deal with the issues. It was slow â€“ the unlearning and learning holistic ways of life and youthful look but I think I cracked it ;)</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">At 38, I feel alive and youthful inside out â€“ my energy levels are fantastic and I donâ€™t use make up at all. Itâ€™s amazing to lead such a maintenance-free and make up-free life! I sleep well and my leaky gut is under control. There is a real mental-emotional-physical blend that happens which doesnâ€™t leave one confused on why we all are supposed to live holistically â€“ it is indeed the most natural way.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">This course is putting my learnings into 10 STEPS and the course starts with proof of my pictures 9 years apart! So no surprises here â€“ only long term, sustainable gains.</p>

<h2 style="padding: 10px 10px;">What Your Masterclass Includes - The Ten Steps</h2>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;"><span class="color_25">1. Superfoods Morning</span></p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">Significance of a good morning routine has been spoken for 1000s of years â€“ so here is one adding superfoods as well. Here we nourish the mind and the body with the best rituals and natural foods.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">2. Shower Routine &amp; Tibetan Rites</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;">I know this comes as a surprise! Does a shower routine bring natural glow? Hell yes! Learn this and also the â€˜Tibetan Ritesâ€™ that gives Dalai Lama a natural glow at 83!</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">3text-align: justify;. Hydration &amp; Glow Juice Recipe</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">We are 85% water so if one thing we need to get right is hydration. Not just by knowing the number of glasses we need to have in a day but what really absorbs the water. Yes and also are you eating water? Letâ€™s learn that too with the glow juice recipe.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">4. Rejuvenate Tea Recipe</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">Can we make our own tea that gives us a natural glow and many other benefits? Most definitely. Here is the oldest Ayurvedic tea recipe that we shall learn to make home and sip all day long</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">5. Gut Health</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">When you learn things like how your digestive system contains more bacteria than you have human cells, and 90% of your serotonin (the neurotransmitter that makes you happy) is made in your gut, youâ€™ll be much more apt to take care of your digestive engine.Â  Iâ€™ll teach you what you need to know without getting too science-y or boring. (My apologies in advance to all scientists who like boring things.)</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">6. Decode Sugar</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">By now you know that you need to learn various foods that have sugar (you will be surprised with the info here!). Knowing doesnâ€™t mean we will live without these foods for the rest of our lives â€“ we will be more alert and mindful and that will bring world of a difference.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">7. Meal Plans with Meal Timings</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">Get your vegetarian and non-vegetarian meal options. Yes with meal timings because there is an awesome secret that lies in doing that.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">8. Collagen Supplement &amp; Blood Test</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">We stopped making our own collagen in our body at 21 so how do you think itâ€™s impacting our skin? What blood test should we do that will point out the important deficiencies directing us to what our body needs? Learn these essential steps here.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">9. Night Routine &amp; Skin Routine</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">If I think there is a more important routine than a morning routine â€“ it is a night routine. In this night routine is also a natural skin routine which eliminates chemicals.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">10. Positive Mental Attitude</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">And I can tell you for sure that if we donâ€™t get to the bottom of this, all of the above wonâ€™t bring out our best potential. Here are simple but powerful tools that will help you to identify your attitude and how to slowly resolve it.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;text-align: justify;">Weâ€™ll pull it all together with actionable tips so you can enjoy your new make up free &amp; maintenance-free lifestyle.</p>

<p style="padding: 10px 10px;">Practitioner.Â </p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;">Somewhere in-between chasing deadlines, pursuing new hobbies, discovering beautiful places, I underwent a â€˜360-degreeâ€™ transformation. I started to question my choices to find my own answers.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;">It was a beautiful (&amp; scary) process of unlearning what Iâ€™d learned as a student, a professional, a friend, a daughter, a woman.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px 10px;">I was vulnerable because I knew the new direction was leading me away from everything I was familiar and comfortable with, everything I was good at! With my last stint as Vice President, Channel V, I decided to take the plunge in this new journey at a Certified Life, Health and Results Coach.</p>
