However, Alzheimerâ€™s disease is an ailment that ruptures the memory of the people. It is a neurodegenerative disease that causes brain cells to die. Initially it messes up with the chronology of events and gradually progresses to forgetfulness of basic habits like eating and pooping too. Alzheimerâ€™s disease is the most common form of dementia.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The progression of Alzheimerâ€™s could be categorized into 3 stages:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><b>Preclinical stage:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here the symptoms donâ€™t occur visibly but the ailment has already started growing.</span></li>

 	<li><b>Dementia: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, the ailment has progressed beyond complete cure.</span></li>

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody can, perhaps, ever point at one factor and believe it to be the sole cause of the disease. However, accidents or brain injuries could be an immediate reason. Other causes of Alzheimerâ€™s include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Nerve damage</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Brain injury</span></li>

</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy lifestyle, balanced diet, routine exercises and mentally stimulating exercises could be extremely helpful.

Medications, however are available to slow down the progress of the disease.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things you must understand is that those suffering from the ailment need utmost care and patience thus, they cannot be left unsupervised even for a minute second.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger is a natural, though sometimes uncalled for or irrational, emotion that everybody experiences from time to time. It is also a healthy emotion. But itâ€™s unhealthy when it flares up all the time and you cease to control yourself in it. Such explosive anger may cause serious problems towards your relationships, your health and your rational decision making.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger Thrives on unfulfilled needs that arise out of excessive dependencies, feeling controlled, believing myths such as â€œletting go of my anger means I am conceding defeat,â€ and â€œself-inflicted anger;â€ How Other Emotions Create Anger - such as pride, fear, loneliness, and inferiority</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adrenaline and Cortisol are the two hormones which our body releases whenever we are angry. These are the same hormones that are released when we encounter stress. Our bodies are not developed to combat these high levels of Adrenaline and Cortisol over long periods or on a very regular basis, which may result in a serious health concern.Â </span>

<strong>Symptoms:</strong>

Some of the common symptoms of Anxiety Disorders (when all other factors have been taken into consideration) are:
<ul>
 	<li>Heart palpitations</li>
 	<li>Shortness of breath</li>
 	<li>Excessive sweating</li>
 	<li>Tremors or twitches</li>
 	<li>Headache</li>

 	<li>Frequent urination or diarrhea</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Fear of losing control or â€œgoing crazyâ€</li>
</ul>
<strong>Overcoming Anxiety Disorders</strong>

Whenever you become anxious or stressed, you induce a flood of the stress hormone cortisol and its consistent presence could damage parts of the brain that process memory and executive functioning. Getting relief for anxiety disorders is then imperative.

One of the first measures in Anxiety management is Medication. Another important and much neglected therapy that can help is Talk therapy. Talking about oneâ€™s condition openly to a qualified therapist can help to find the right solutions. Lifestyle changes are known to help: getting enough sleep and exercise is seen to bring about beneficial effects. But one must keep away from alcohol, caffeine and other mood-altering substances as they are known to have a negative impact.

<strong>Food can be medicinal. Given below are some foods that can boost brain health and reduce anxiety:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>chamomile</li>
 	<li>turmeric</li>
 	<li>dark chocolate</li>
 	<li>yogurt</li>
 	<li>green tea</li>
</ul>
<strong>Going beyond the holistic approach</strong>

Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Anxiety Disorders by way of curing the disease but not its roots. Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€ According to her, the main cause of anxiety is: Not trusting the flow and the process of life. This lack of faith manifests in our bodies as anxiety. One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.

Her affirmation for healing Anxiety Disorders is: <em><strong>I love and approve of myself and I trust in the process of life. I am safe.</strong></em>

Other alternative therapies that have also given good results for treating this disorder are:

Heart arrhythmias may feel like a little problem with the heart. However, some cases can be worrisome and life-threatening. Heart arrhythmias can cause:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase in Heartbeat</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chest pain</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow heartbeat</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortness of breath</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dizziness</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Keeping your heart health</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People with arrhythmia need to keep their heart healthy. And hereâ€™s the best way to do this:</span>

<b>Limit your caffeine intake: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who love coffee or energy drinks should, at least stay conscious of how much they drink. For energy drinks, its best to strictly avoid them.</span>

<b>Reduce alcohol intake: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcohol is known to increase blood pressure which has been linked to Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<b>Stay active: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise improves heart health. It's advisable to choose cardio over weightlifting exercises. As opposed to peopleâ€™s notion, yoga helps to improve the symptoms of Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<b>Shed off some pounds: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most significant steps to take is to shed off some extra weight. Overweight or obese people are at higher risk of having Heart arrhythmias or even other heart related problems. Warning: don't try to lose weight with diet pills; it can cause Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<b>Sleep well for a healthy heart: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping very well prevents the risk of developing the condition. It helps to reduce the stress pressure in the heart. Sleeping period of 7-9 hours in a day is healthy enough.</span>

<b>Don't be nonchalant with your Heart arrhythmias: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While your doctor might tell you that your Heart arrhythmias may not mean any harm, that doesnâ€™t mean it cannot lead to serious cases. It can lead to uncomfortable conditions that you may not be able to live with. Always keep them in check.</span>

<b>Avoid smoking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay clear of smoking. It can cause heart diseases including Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, you can live a healthy life with arrhythmias. Always maintain your heart health.</span>

Globally, Arthritis is a form of joint disease and is the leading cause of disabilities among Older Adults. Newborn and children are not left out. In fact, annually, over 300,000 newborn and children in the world have it. In 2019, the number of people expected to have arthritis is estimated to be around 78 million. There are two types of Arthritis: Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis.Â </span>

<b>Rheumatoid Arthritis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder which can affect more than the joints. In fact, for some, this condition can result in the damage of other parts of the body system, including the eyes, skin, lungs, and blood vessels.</span>

<b>SymptomsÂ </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warm, tender, swollen joints</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stiffness of the joints- generally worse early in the morning or after a long time of idleness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever, fatigue, and appetite loss</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Risk factors</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that may increase the chances of rheumatoid arthritis include age, sex, smoking, and family history.</span>

<b>Osteoarthritis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent type of arthritis that affects millions of people from all over the world. This form of arthritis occurs when the protective cartilage at the edges of the bone wears out.</span><b>Â </b>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of Osteoarthritis typically develop slowly and become worse over time. They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stiffness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenderness</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Lifestyle changes to tackle Arthritis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat a healthy diet that contains antioxidants to prevent inflammation</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain an exercise regimen to keep the joints flexible</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also make sure youâ€™re not overweight as that tends to put more pressure on the knee joints</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow good sleeping habits so you get adequate, good quality rest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meditation can help one calm down and also visualise healing.</span>

Or say, the â€˜puff or asthalinâ€™ a lot of children carry to school? These are children or people who have breathing problems as a result of asthma. Around the globe, roughly 2,50,000 die of asthma every year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Asthma is a condition of the bronchial tubes or the airways to the lungs. The ailment causes inflammation or swelling in the bronchial tubes and can make you breathless. Asthma is pretty common and those with asthma do not ever get fully cured, but the disease can be managed very well now. Extremely emotional events could also lead to asthma attacks.</span>

<b>Types</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many types of asthma, depending on their onset and severity. Some of them are:</span>

<b>Childhood asthma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is an intermittent form of asthma and reportedly, more children experience asthma attacks than elders. Second-hand smoke, cigarette exposure could be reasons for developing childhood asthma.</span>

<b>Adult-onset asthma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Asthma can begin at any age. Adult-onset asthma could be a result of other ailments too. For example, obesity is a major risk factor.</span>

<b>Occupational asthma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is a kind of asthma that occurs as a result of any profession or occupation.</span>

<b>Seasonal asthma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is one of the most commonly heard-of. For some people, the environment around them and even the climate can trigger asthma. For example, the weather, Diwali time because of the smoke caused by crackers, and so on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting is the new smoking. Sedentary lifestyles have become the norm with most interactions taking place in the virtual world. All this downward facing into the smartphone can result in a bad posture. Ergo, back pain. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though trauma and fractures can cause back pain, the more common reason is an everyday activity performed incorrectly: carrying a heavy laptop bag on the shoulder instead of in a backpack, bending over to pick up something from the floor, slouched over on the couch binge-watching Netflix.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation in India is quite dismal. According to a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Spine Day 2017 Insights Report by a well-known Spine Clinic, 41.2% of the population in India suffers from Herniated Disc (Slipped Disc) and the most common pain is lower back pain.</span>

<b>Preventing Back Pain</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The spinal column, our backbone, holds the weight of the head and the torso. Its flexibility allows us to twist and turn in any direction and perform many acrobatic actions. Taking care of this precious asset will keep our back happy and consequently, us too.</span>

<b>Here are some effective tips:</b>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become stress-free: Stress causes us to tense our muscles and this can cause a backache.</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good posture: Invest in ergonomic furniture and make sure you take a short walking break every hour at work so your muscles remain flexible and the back remains strong.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep sideways: The back gets proper support when one sleeps sideways . Avoid sleeping on the back or stomach but if you must, support your neck and lower back with rolled towels or small pillows.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy diet: Keep your digestive system working well with the right balance and mix of foods. This will avoid putting a strain on your back.</span></li>

In slang, this act is popularly called, â€œdumping someoneâ€ when the process is initiated by one of the involved party.</span>

<b>Why Do People Break Up?</b>

<b>Cheating</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheating or infidelity is the leading cause of most breakups. Men and women cheat for reasons best known to them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cases of cheating started with a seemingly innocent friendship. Itâ€™s really hard to rebuild a relationship after cheating.</span>

<b>Financial infidelity</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Money controls everything. Everything ranging from expenses to financial goals to spending habits causing everyday complaints can end a relationship. Financial infidelity is one of the highest causes of divorce, after infidelity.</span>

<b>Lack of communication</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication defines a healthy relationship. The inability to communicate effectively can destroy a beautiful affair.</span>

<b>Being unsupportive</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If partners cannot support each other when down or stressed by some life events, then the relationship isnâ€™t worth it and itâ€™s heading to the rocks soon.</span>

<b>How To Avoid A BreakupÂ </b>

<b>Remove the thoughts of breaking up</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that youâ€™ll be a better person without your partner can destroy your motivation to make the relationship work. Keeping in mind that breaking up is a â€œNO, NOâ€ can strengthen the bond in your relationship.</span>

<b>Always respect your partner</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your partner is the best and thatâ€™s why you fell in love with them in the first place. The best way you prove it is by showing them some respect.</span>

<b>Improve your communication</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing can substitute those regular talks and gossips between lovers. When there is sharing of thoughts and feelings, the bond between partners grows stronger. Partners should set aside some time every day to just discuss together.</span>

<b>Be supportive</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your best to give your partner what they need most. Even if they donâ€™t open up on their needs, find a way to figure it out. And if youâ€™re unsure, just ask!</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"4";}i:43;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1190";s:4:"name";s:13:"Breast Cancer";s:4:"slug";s:13:"breast-cancer";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1190";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:4324:"Breast cancer constitutes to over 16% of cancers in women all over the world.

This uncontrollable growth usually develops into a tumor which is felt like a bump and visible only on an x-ray. According to Lucy Stenon, a breast cancer specialist from the University of York, â€œAlertness of the symptoms and necessity of screening are imperative ways of lowering the riskâ€.

<b>Symptoms of Breast Cancer</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of breast cancer are generally noticed in areas of the breast with thickened tissues or a lump in the breast or armpit region.</span>

<b>Some other symptoms are:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pains in the breast or armpits</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Redness or pitting of the breast skin</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rashes around or one some parts of the nipples</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nipple discharge that sometimes contains blood</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inverted or sunken nipples</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A sudden change in breast shape or size</span></li>
</ul>
<b>What causes Breast Cancer?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a woman reaches puberty, her breast contains fats, connective tissues, and several glands that manufacture milk for breastfeeding. Ducts or Tiny tubes take the milk to the nipple. Â Often, breast cancer starts in the interior lining of the lobules or milk ducts that provide milk.</span>

<b>Prevention</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no specific way to prevent breast cancer, although certain lifestyle preferences can exceptionally lower the chances of breast cancer. They are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Steering clear of excessive alcohol intake</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Routinely pursuing a healthy diet containing fruits and vegetables</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular exercise</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining a good Body Mass Index</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women should carefully examine their breastfeeding options and avoid using HRT after menopause because these can increase the risk.</span>

Common colds are usually harmless and may not be severe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide, children younger than 6 years have a higher risk of having common colds. Older adults can also experience two or three colds in a year. On an average, younger children develop up to 8 colds in a year with older adults only having up to 4 colds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people affected by common cold recover within 3 days to a week. However, recovery might take longer in people who smoke. Most symptoms of common colds appear within 3 days of exposure to the virus.Â </span>

<b>Although the signs and symptoms vary from person to person, the general signs include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cough</span></li>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Younger children of age six and below have a higher risk of cold.</span>

<b>Weak immune system: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with chronic illnesses or weak immune system have a higher risk of developing cold.</span>

<b>Season: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both adults and children are likely to develop colds in falls and winters. Nevertheless, common cold can develop at any time.</span>

<b>Smoking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking can cause and in fact, lead to severe cases.</span>

<b>Causes Of Common Cold</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While different types of viruses can cause a cold, rhinoviruses are the most common of them all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These viruses get into the body through the eyes, mouth or nose. They can also spread through air droplets of an infected person whenever they sneeze or cough.</span>

<b>Healthy ways to Prevent Common Cold</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There's no special drug or vaccine to cure a cold, but implementing some lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of contacting cold virus:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink up to eight 250 mL cups daily. However, pregnant women should drink more.</span>

<b>Other fluid options for common cold include:</b>

It is caused by a long-term exposure to substances that irritate the lungs. According to studies, COPD has a prevalence of 251 million cases worldwide in 2016. In fact, in 2018, approximately 3 million deaths were caused by the inflammatory disease with 90% of COPD deaths recorded in third world countries.</span>

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking cigarettes is the leading cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). About 20-30% of hardcore smokers develop COPD while long-term smokers may develop a reduction in lung function.Â  In developing countries, it usually occurs when people inhale fumes from burning fuel.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of COPD are usually detected after significant damage has been done to the lung, which often worsens over time, especially if exposed to more smoke.</span>

<b>Some other conditions that COPD can cause are:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Short breath</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chest tightness</span></li>

 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ankles, feet or leg swelling</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Risk factors for COPD</b>

<b>Smoking tobacco</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As aforementioned, the most common risk factor for COPD is smoking. The more the smoke the higher your risk of COPD.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asthma patients who smoke</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asthma combined with smoking triggers your risk of COPD.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to dust and chemical fumes</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to all these can inflame and irritate your lungs.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Keeping A Healthy Lung With The Best Diet</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often times, we care less for our lungs. But they help us stay alive. Thatâ€™s why we must prioritize their health. Although the body has natural defense systems which protect the lungs, there are certain diets that must be included in order to reduce the risk of COPD.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research, people who consumed a high-fat, low-carb supplement showed improvement than those who took high-carb diets. Also, try to include the following into your daily diet:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein-rich foodsÂ </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include complex carbohydrates because they are high in fiber.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foods to add to your diets include peas, quinoa, beans, bran, potatoes with skin, lentils, oats, barley.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruits and vegetables contain minerals, vitamins, and fibers.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium-rich foods such as avocado, tomatoes, beets, oranges, bananas.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Preventing COPD</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">COPD can be prevented. Most cases have been linked to smoking, so the best way to prevent it is to quit smoking. Sure, this simple statement may not look simple if youâ€™re a hardcore smoker, but you can quit. Itâ€™s all about trying.</span>

<b>Diet care for Eczema</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since inflammation is believed to cause eczema in many cases, it is advisable to avoid all inflammation-causing foods which include nuts, milk and wheat.</span>

We have all heard about migraine which results in nausea, well this is just a notch down. It has been reported that every year more than 100 lakh cases are registered in India for tension headache. This is also the most common type of headache, and yet people have not seen a decline in the number of cases for the same.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, tension headaches are primarily caused by excessive stress. But the actual cause of tension headaches is unknown. Experts came up with a theory which stated tension headaches are stemmed from muscle contractions in the face, neck, and scalp, perhaps as a result of heightened emotions, tension or stress.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But several types of research since then, have suggested that muscle contractions cannot be assumed as the only cause. Increased muscle tenderness, a common symptom of tension headaches, may result from a sensitized pain system, which is also known to cause tension headaches. It is common for some people to develop tension headaches after staring at a computer screen for a long time, or long after driving for long hours.Â </span>

Globally, high blood pressure has claimed over 7.5 million deaths. It accounts for 12.8% of the total global deaths.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide, the general prevalence of high blood pressure is in adults older than 25 years. And due to aging and population increment, the overall number of persons affected with high blood pressure-induced hypertension has risen from 600 million in 1980 to 1 billion in 2008. Itâ€™s possible to have high blood pressure for years without showing symptoms.</span>

<b>Symptoms Of High Blood Pressure</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cases of high blood pressure started with no symptoms, even when they reach a life-threatening level.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few people with high blood pressure show generic signs like headache, nosebleeds, or shortness of breath, but these signs arenâ€™t particular to high blood pressure and may be ignored.</span>

<b>Causes Of High Blood Pressure</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">High blood pressure is made up of two types: primary hypertension and secondary hypertension.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary hypertension usually develops slowly for years. Secondary hypertension can be caused by hidden health conditions such as sleep apnea, thyroid problem, kidney problem, wrong medication like a birth control pill.</span>

<b>Risk Factors Of High Blood Pressure</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some risk factors of high blood pressure include:</span>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of developing high blood pressure increases with age. The disease is more prevalent in men above the age of 64 and 65 for women.</span>

<b>Family history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some families, high blood pressure is hereditary.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other risk factors include being overweight, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking of tobacco.</span>

<b>Treatment Of High Blood Pressure</b>

<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercising</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating heart-healthy foods</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consuming less salt</span></li>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some cases may require medical attention.</span>

<b>Treating High Blood Pressure with lifestyle changes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifestyle changes can play a huge role in preventing high blood pressure. Some of the lifestyle changes include:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss is the most important step to control blood pressure. Shed off extra pounds and stay conscious of your waistline as excessive weights around your waistline can increase your chances of high blood pressure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, insomnia left untreated, can put you at risk for health issues like obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.</span>

<b>Improving sleep</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, taking some simple but healthy steps can improve sleep:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid drinking liquids 2-3 hours before sleep so you are not awakened for bladder relief</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep the television and computer out of the bedroom</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid e-devices at least an hour before bedtime.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the same sleep schedule everyday including on weekends</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid after-meals afternoon naps</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercising is important for sleeping well but doing it very close to bedtime over-activates the body and skews up the body-clock</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid smoking, drinking or big, spicy meals at night.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a bedtime ritual: make the bed, dim the lights, maintain a comfortable temperature, wear soothing night clothes, play white sound in the background and so on.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Eat right. Sleep tight.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some foods help keep sleep-snatchers away. Hereâ€™s a list of them:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milk - a small cup of warm milk induces a nice sleepy buzz. Itâ€™s also an instant antidote for acid reflux so allâ€™s win-win.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy carbs - A couple of whole-wheat crackers or a roti or two can make you hit the sack in a jiffy.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese - contains tryptophan that aids the body to feel relaxed and sleepy (so avoid cheese when youâ€™ve got a heavy work day ahead).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cherries - </span><a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.28.1_supplement.830.9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that drinking two glasses of cherry juice daily gave insomniacs and additional 90 minutes of sleep time. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herbal infusions of chamomile tea, kashmiri kava, valerian root and California Poppy, sipped just before bedtime can give restful sleep.</span></li>
</ol>
<b>Going beyond the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Insomnia. Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€ According to her, the main cause of </span><b>Insomnia is </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Fear. Not trusting the process of life. Guilt. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Insomnia is</span><b>: </b><b>Â </b><b><i>I love and approve of myself and I trust in the process of life. I am safe. Â </i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other alternative therapies that have also given good results for treating this disorder are: </span>

</ul>
<b>Causes Of IBS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knows the exact cause of IBS. Some factors play a major role and they include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction of the intestinal muscle</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abnormalities in the digestive system nerves</span></li>

</ul>
<b>Risk Factors Of IBS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people experience occasional signs of the syndrome, but the followingÂ  category of people are likely to have IBS;</span>

<b>Young people: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those under age 50 may experience the syndrome.</span>

<b>Female: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, IBS is prevalent among women.</span>

<b>Family history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genes play a major role in health. A family history of IBS may increase your chances of having one.</span>

<b>Mental health issues: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depression, anxiety and mental health can't be linked with IBS.</span>

<b>Preventing IBS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no cure for irritable bowel syndrome, but it can be managed by incurring some diet and lifestyle changes.</span>

<b>Make a food/symptom journal for a week.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice that a certain food discomforts your body, try removing it from your diet and see if it works.Â  If there is no change in symptoms after some weeks, you can add it back to your diet.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve your digestion:</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat at the right time, every day.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donâ€™t eat too much</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure youâ€™re relaxed before eating</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always chew well before swallowing</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink more fluid and make water your preferred option. For women, 9 cups of water a day is cool. For men, 12 cups a day is ideal.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include more fiber in your diet</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For women, 25g of dietary fiber per day is great, while 38g per day is ideal for men. If you eat too much fiber, reduce it and see if things change. Also, if you eat less of fiber, try increasing it and watching for symptoms.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steer clear of snacks and high-fat meals.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A meal containing excess fat can lead to cramping and diarrhea. Examples of these foods include cream, cheese, fried foods, chocolate, cookies, and regular ground beef.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating healthy fats such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds, canola, can help.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce your caffeine intake</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce alcohol.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Other ways of reducing the effects of IBS include:</b>

<b>Counseling: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A counselor can guide you on how to change or modify your response to stressful situations.</span>

<b>Progressive relaxation exercise: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an exercise that helps your body muscles relax, one by one.</span>

<b>Mindfulness training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This training reduces stress and keeps you focused on the moment and ward off all distractions and worries.</span>

But with the onset of this century, this disease seems to affecting a lot of people. Cellular overgrowth is one of the biggest problems associated with cancer. When this overgrowth occurs in lungs and causes the cells contained within to divide, it is termed as lung cancer.</span>

<b>What to eat?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy diet could be your weapon against any ailment. Here are a few things you must have to fight lung cancer:</span>
<ul>

<b>Treatment</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment for lung cancer depends heavily on 3 factors: Overall health, stage of the cancer and the location of cancer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chemotherapy will be your doctorâ€™s first mode of medication. Everything depends on the severity of the condition you are currently undergoing. Surgery could also be other mode of treatment. Radiation therapy is said to be quite helpful too. Of all the above, targeted radiation therapy is one of the most banked upon option.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of cancer is: </span><b>Deep hurt. Longstanding resentment. Deep secret or grief eating away at the self. Carrying hatreds. "What's the use?"</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating cancer is</span><b>: I lovingly forgive and release all of the past. I choose to fill my world with joy.

It is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Every year, there are tons of people getting affected due to this ailment. It has been reported that young children from Africa are the worst affected clan.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have surely heard of malaria and its symptoms. Though it is very common among children, adults too are equally affected. Its symptoms include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever with chills and shivering, especially seen in the late evening hours</span></li>

</ul>
<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Malaria is caused by a parasitic bite. However, here are the different stages of the transmission cycle:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uninfected mosquito: A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on an infected person.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transmission: Now whoever this mosquito bites, will get infected with the parasite.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liver: Once they enter you, they enter your liver and cause you an infection.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloodstream: After a period, these parasites leave your liver and enter into your bloodstream. This is when you see the symptoms.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transmission: In this stage, if an uninfected mosquito bites you, it will get infected - thereby continuing with this cycle.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Malaria can also be transmitted in these ways:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a mother to an unborn child</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">through infected needles </span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One must know that a balanced diet and physical exercise could be very helpful too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some preventive measures include keeping the environment clean and getting rid of clutter and stagnating water. It is important to use mosquito repellents over all exposed areas of the body when you are going to be in a woody (or garden) area. </span>

<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, there are no vaccines available for malaria. Typically, antimalarial medicine kills the parasite. For years, scientists and researchers have been trying their best to find a way to develop these drugs further, however, it hasnâ€™t been very successful.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€ </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of malaria is: </span><b>Out of balance with nature and with life. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating malaria is</span><b>: I am united and balanced with all of life. I am safe. Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative therapies for treating malaria have been widespread and age old. There havenâ€™t been a lot of medical developments in terms of antimalarial treatments and thus, alternative medicines help us in a big way. Herbal treatments or antimalarial herbal medicines, yoga, meditation, naturopathy, reiki, body massages, homeopathy, Ayurveda and acupressure can help you in healing faster too.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}i:180;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1276";s:4:"name";s:12:"Malnutrition";s:4:"slug";s:12:"malnutrition";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1276";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:6474:"<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of us cannot quite understand the meaning of malnutrition fully well. While it is true that poor nutrition or imbalance of nutrition causes malnutrition in our population, it is not fully correct to say that only low levels of nutrition can cause this condition; yes, excess of nutrition can also call for malnutrition. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), â€œMalnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a personâ€™s intake of energy and/or nutrients.â€</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly speaking, there are two facets of malnutrition- Undernutrition and overweight. </span>

<b>Under nutrition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as the name suggests, is a condition that could cause stunting (low height for that age), wasting (low weight for that age) or serious deficiencies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overweight, on the other hand, causes serious ailments like obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer.</span>

<b>What to eat?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Malnutrition is very closely related to what and how much you consume. Diet plays the most important role in the treatment as well as curing of this ailment. Always opt for a balanced meal that has adequate amount of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals and plenty of fluids. Make sure you consume sufficient amounts of clean drinking water throughout the day.</span>

<b>Treatment</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular treatments for curing malnutrition is improvising your diet. Most physicians will direct you to a nutritionist, in order to treat your deficiencies. Consuming dietary supplements can come in handy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Karshayahara yoga, feeding of ambrosial nectar, reiki, naturopathy, Ayurveda as well as Homeopathy could be quite helpful in treating malnutrition too.</span>

They may experience pain in the back and stomach - for a minimal period of time and then get on with their life. Their periods occur at a fixed time gap of say 22-28 days.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But for other set of women, menstruation could be a real pain. Apart from emotional as well as physical symptoms, these women could experience uncontrollable mood swings, terrible back, stomach and abdominal pain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A normal menstrual cycle is the one that occurs once in 28 days indicating various changes in different parts of your body like uterus, breasts, ovaries and vagina. A normal menstrual cycle runs for about 5-7 days. However, you must understand that a set of factors like heredity plays a key role in your menstruation. Here are 4 common abnormalities that are experienced by women:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span> <b>Abnormal uterine bleeding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This includes one of the 3 conditions- Irregular periods (bleeding between periods), no bleeding (amenorrhea) or heavy bleeding.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 3 conditions stated above, heavy bleeding is the most common one. It is believed that 1 in 5 women experience this. Bleeding is considered to be heavy when it interferes with your life in a way that you may have to take leave from work or school and so on. A normal menstrual bleeding is about 5 tablespoons a day. In case of heavy bleeding, you may have to change your pad or tampons every hour (rather than 4 pads a day).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span> <b>Amenorrhea</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the condition where you do not experience any menstrual bleeding. This could be due to menopause, pregnancy, stress and hormonal imbalance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span> <b>Dysmenorrhea (severe menstrual cramps)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Most women will experience some sort of painful menstrual cramps as a part of monthly routine. However, if this is unbearable and interferes with your walking or sleeping cycles, you may have to immediately call for help.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">4)</span> <b>Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a set of emotional, psychological as well as physical symptoms that occur right before a period. These severely rupture your lifestyle. The symptoms include:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Swollen, painful breasts</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Bloating</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) Terrible mood swings</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">d) Irritability</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e) Anxiety</span></li>
</ol>
<b>Treatment</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we know that these disorders are caused due to hormonal imbalances, stress and heredity, there is very little that we can do in terms of treatment. However, there are multiple over-the-counter drugs that may solve your woes and give relief from painful symptoms. In extreme cases, you may be advised to undergo a surgery.</span>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It is also possible to have these symptoms without any headache. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on symptoms and clinical history, migraines are categorised into those </span><b>with aura </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(classic migraines) and those </span><b>without aura </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(common migraines).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a study conducted in Eastern India, the results showed that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 14.12% of the respondents had migraine. The maximum burden was among women aged between 30 and 34 years.</span>

<b>Causes of Migraine</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No definite cause(s) have been identified for migraines but triggers are many. Changes in brain chemicals, e.g. decrease in the level of serotonin can activate a migraine. </span>

<b>Other triggers include:</b>

<b>Emotional factors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress, anxiety, depression, trauma</span>

<b>Diet: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobacco,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">caffeine or caffeine withdrawal, skipped meals, alcohol, chocolate, aged cheeses, Monosodium glutamate (MSG), fermented or pickled goods, yeast, cured meats, some fruits and nuts, dehydration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Sensory overload:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Strong smells, loud noises, bright or flashing lights, sudden changes in weather</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Physical conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often), too much or not enough sleep, hormonal changes in women, Overexertion (too much physical activity), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">low blood sugar and jet lag.</span>

<b>Managing Migraines</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migraine sufferers wish they could pop a pill and get immediate relief from the debilitation that a migraine can cause. But since that is not a thing, the next best course of action is prevention. The frequency of a migraine attack </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be controlled by adopting these measures in oneâ€™s lifestyle: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting enough sleep</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing stress</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drinking plenty of water</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoiding certain foods</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular physical exercise</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping a migraine log to see what foods, medicines or activities trigger the migraine</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gluten-free diet can be helpful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no cure for migraines but Â doing these things can help to alleviate the discomfort:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Drinking fluids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>Going beyond the holistic approach</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Migraines.

Need we explain about how there has been a spike in cases of obesity among children and youth? All that junk foods we gobble down and the lack of exercise has caused more harm than anything else.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study focusing on how the world is becoming obese. The pan-global research analyzed nearly 68 million people through 1980 to 2015 and found that 12 per cent of adults and 5 per cent of children could be classified as â€˜obese.â€™ Thatâ€™s how severe the ailment is.</span>

<b>Causes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for obesity may seem rather obvious to us. Here are some of the many reasons leading to obesity:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Genetics</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Junk food</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Lack of physical exercise</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Chronic stress</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Certain medications like antidepressants, insulin etc.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Hormone imbalance</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Excessive sugar consumption</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What one should clearly understand is that fixing the causes could be of great help. In the current scenario, childhood obesity is a major problem for us to deal with. Children should be tested and evaluated for genetic as well as hormonal imbalances. Once they are diagnosed positive to any of these, they can be well directed to medications.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bariatric treatment, surgery or medications could be a good option. However, we suggest you opt for a healthy lifestyle to see if that helps:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Exercise regularly: Something as simple as walking, jogging or cycling could help in the long run.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Play outdoor games like badminton, cricket or football that can help in some family indulgence time also.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Avoid sugary foods.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Say no to junk foods. Junk is actually what the name suggests, junk. It needs to be controlled and if possible, eliminated from your regular diet completely.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Reduce stress.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her,Â  obesity is caused due to: </span><b>An inherent fear, need for protection and running away from feelings, insecurity, seeking fulfilment, and self-rejection.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating obesity is: </span><b>I am at peace with my own feelings. I am safe where I am. I create my own security. I love and approve of myself</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from medications, alternative therapies could be of great help too. Some of these are Nutritional therapy, herbal therapy, acupressure, acupuncture or hydrotherapy too.Â </span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:2:"56";}i:204;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1333";s:4:"name";s:35:"OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)";s:4:"slug";s:33:"obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1333";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:2445:"<span style="font-weight: 400;">Washing hands constantly, checking if the same door is locked about 3 times or more or wanting things to be aligned all the time could well be an indicator of OCD, but let us not be fooled by considering these traits as symptoms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To explain what OCD is, letâ€™s take this example: We have a lock system in our cars that rings an alarm each time somebody breaks it open. Remember this lock system is your mind. Now imagine the lock system is spoilt and sets off alarms in a sporadic interval. Each time it rings, you may go and check it over and over again, eventually after a point you realize it is the spoilt lock system and you calm down. But for those people with OCD, they know the alarm is spoilt but still find the need to check the car over and over again because it causes immense anxiety.Â </span>

<b>These are some symptoms to watch out for:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Repetitive obsessions and intrusive, fearful thoughts.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Recurrent, disturbing mental images.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Compulsions like aligning things at home over and over again (to control the anxiety).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents must be watchful if their children, especially between 7-12 years of age, exhibit such symptoms.</span>

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing with a lot of psychiatric illness is that you cannot pinpoint one cause and say what has caused them. However, those with a family history of OCD could be more prone to it than others.</span>

<b>Foods to eat</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is believed that a lot of ailments could be cured by eating right. For those suffering from OCD, it is advised to have foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids like chia seeds, walnuts and low-fat dairy products like low-fat milk etc.</span>

<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">OCD doesnâ€™t have a definitive cure, however, it can be treated through medication and various therapies like family therapy, behavioural therapy and so on.Â </span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative therapies that could help in curing OCD include Reiki, Dr. Bach flower remedies, Pranic healing, Acupressure, Energy healing.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}i:207;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1305";s:4:"name";s:16:"Orgasm Disorders";s:4:"slug";s:16:"orgasm-disorders";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1305";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"4";}i:212;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1198";s:4:"name";s:17:"Pancreatic Cancer";s:4:"slug";s:17:"pancreatic-cancer";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1198";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";}i:213;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1331";s:4:"name";s:13:"Panic Attacks";s:4:"slug";s:13:"panic-attacks";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1331";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:4248:"<span style="font-weight: 400;">A panic attack is a sudden feeling of intense fear that results in serious physical reactions even without any reason or impending danger.

Globally, 1 in 9 men experiences prostate cancer at a time in their life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostate cancer is most common in older men as well as in African-American men. According to a diagnosis report, about 6 in 10 cases of prostate cancer are in men aged 65 or older, and it is uncommon in men less than 40 years. In fact, the average global age of diagnosis is about 66.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostate Cancer grows slowly and is restricted to the prostate gland, where it is not life-threatening. However, even though some prostate cancer slowly grows without complications, others can be aggressive and spread to other areas of the body.Â  Detecting prostate cancer- when itâ€™s only limited to the prostate gland- can be successfully treated.</span>

</ul>
<b>Causes Of Prostate Cancer</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors are unclear on what causes prostate cancer. Based on available information, prostate cancer occurs when the prostate cells start showing some abnormality. Mutations in the DNA of the abnormal cells make them grow and rapidly divide abnormally. The abnormal cells continue to function while others die off. These cells then grow to form a tumor which produces the seminal fluid.</span>

An estimated 7% of men and 5% of women in the world have sleep apnea. Also, globally, about 100 million people suffer from sleep apnea.</span>

<b>Symptoms Of Sleep Apnea</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loud snoring</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache that occurs only in the morning</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gasping for air during sleep</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trouble with sleeping</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irritability</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Â </b>

<b>Causes Of Sleep Apnea</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medically, sleep apnea occurs when the muscles located at the end of the throat are relaxed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This relaxed muscle makes your airways narrower whenever you breathe in which reduces the amount of air flowing in. The brain detects your struggle with breathing and rouses you from sleep so the airways can be reopened. The awakening process is so brief that you may not remember it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In some other severe (and rare) form of Sleep Apnea, the brain refuses to send signals to the breathing muscles.</span>

<b>Who can be affected:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sleep disorder can affect anyone, not leaving out children. But a number of factors that trigger its occurrence include:</span>

<b>Obesity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive weight increases the risk of sleep apnea. Fats present in the upper airway can disrupt proper air flow.</span>

<b>Narrowed airway: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with narrow throat (which are often inherited) have a higher risk of sleep apnea.</span>

<b>Male: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibility of males having sleep apnea is twice or thrice that of females. Also, women, after menopause have a higher risk.</span>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep apnea is most common among older adults.</span>

<b>Family history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a family history of sleep apnea might trigger the possibility of having one too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other factors include smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and heart disorder.</span>

<b>Lifestyle changes for the treatment Of Sleep Apnea</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For mild cases of sleep apnea, a change in lifestyle is recommended. They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shed off some pounds</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing weight can open your throat and reduce sleep apnea.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop smoking</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking increases inflammation in the throat. So it's advisable to stop smoking.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using sleeping pills or taking alcohol before sleeping. It disrupts smooth breathing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain Regular Exercise: Regular exercise has a major influence on the quality of sleep. Yoga is also a good practice that will strengthen your airways.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid caffeinated drinks and heavy meals at night.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain a consistent sleep hour. It keeps you relaxed and you sleep better.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedtime steps to reducing sleep apnea</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep on your side</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't sleep on your back. It makes it easier for your soft tissues and tongue to interfere with smooth breathing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move your head up</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raise your bed's head by up to 6 inches. You can also use a cervical pillow for the elevation.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a nasal dilator or nasal irrigation system to keep your nasal passage open at night.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If these steps don't improve your symptoms or if you're suffering from a severe level of apnea, medical treatment might be recommended. There are certain devices that can aid free breathing during sleep. Other forms of treatment include surgery and therapy.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Sleep Apnea is: </span><b>Fear, anxiety, and feeling threatened.Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Sleep Apnea is: </span><b>I lovingly protect myself with thought of joy and peace. The past is forgiven and forgotten. I am free in this moment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}i:276;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1117";s:4:"name";s:26:"Solitary Nodule of Thyroid";s:4:"slug";s:26:"solitary-nodule-of-thyroid";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1117";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}i:285;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1389";s:4:"name";s:6:"Stress";s:4:"slug";s:6:"stress";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1389";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:3:"214";}i:287;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1339";s:4:"name";s:30:"Substance Abuse ( Addictions )";s:4:"slug";s:26:"substance-abuse-addictions";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1339";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";}i:288;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1349";s:4:"name";s:51:"Suicidal Tendencies / Behavior (Cognitive disorder)";s:4:"slug";s:47:"suicidal-tendencies-behavior-cognitive-disorder";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1349";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"3";}i:293;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1219";s:4:"name";s:25:"Thinning Hair / Hair Loss";s:4:"slug";s:23:"thinning-hair-hair-loss";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1219";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}i:294;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1199";s:4:"name";s:14:"Thyroid Cancer";s:4:"slug";s:14:"thyroid-cancer";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1199";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"3";}i:298;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1366";s:4:"name";s:22:"Toxic Work Environment";s:4:"slug";s:22:"toxic-work-environment";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1366";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}i:300;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1279";s:4:"name";s:6:"Trauma";s:4:"slug";s:6:"trauma";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1279";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:3310:"<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trauma is a mental and emotional response of a person to an extremely negative incident. Although trauma is a normal response to horrible events, its after-effect can be so severe that they affect the victimâ€™s ability to live a normal life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to NCIPC, globally, trauma is the number one cause of death among people from age 1â€“46.</span>

<b>Causes Of Trauma</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trauma is usually caused by a serious negative event that results in a long-term impact on the metal and emotional stability of the victim. Even though most traumas are physically-induced, others are psychological. However, the common causes of trauma include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural disaster</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rape</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death of a loved one</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serious illness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Being a prisoner of war</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Sexual abuse as a child</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Symptoms Of Trauma</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the causes and symptoms of trauma vary, there are some general signs of trauma to check out.</span>

<b>Emotionally disorganized</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who just came out from traumatic events usually appear emotionally disorganized. They can be recognized by their shaken and disoriented attitude.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They donâ€™t respond to conversations in a way that a normal person should. They often withdraw from the conversation.</span>

<b>Anxiety</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sign of a victim of a traumatic event is anxiety. Trauma-induced anxiety can be evident in situations such as nightmares, irritability, mood swings, edginess, and lack of concentration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People respond to trauma in various ways. In fact, relatives and friends may not virtually notice the symptoms in some victims.</span>

<b>Treatment Of Trauma</b>

<b>Trauma- Maintain a regular exercise</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A regular 30 minutes exercise daily is good. Rhythmic exercises such as running, walking, basketball or even swimming engages your arms and leg</span>

<b>Add mindfulness components</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than concentrating on the exercise or distracting yourself, concentrate on your body as you move.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boxing, rock climbing, or martial arts are a good example of mindfulness exercise.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several trauma management program options available to victims. Due to the unpredictably varying nature of the condition, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. Each patient has their own individual approach and treatments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first approach is to aid the quick recovery of the physical effects of trauma. Burned skin, broken bones, and other organs that require a specific treatment will be treated before moving over to the psychological healing process.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";}i:307;O:8:"stdClass":9:{s:7:"term_id";s:4:"1295";s:4:"name";s:7:"Typhoid";s:4:"slug";s:7:"typhoid";s:10:"term_group";s:1:"0";s:16:"term_taxonomy_id";s:4:"1295";s:8:"taxonomy";s:7:"ailment";s:11:"description";s:3485:"<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ğ¢ÑƒÑ€hĞ¾Ñ–d Ñ–s Ğ° life-threatening infection caused by a bacterium known as Salmonella Typhi.
