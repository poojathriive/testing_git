<b><span style="font-size: large;">Work - The World</span></b>

The Magician is an excellent card for relationships. It brings magical relationships, magical love, magical people and magical moments with your loved ones into your life. You will find yourself strongly attracted, excited and obsessed with your partner, family or loved ones and these feelings will be reciprocated. However, excess of any sort can lead to a problem. So, it is important to maintain a balance in 2019. Get to know the other person better before you invest your trust, feelings and love in them or the relationship.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">The Bigger Picture - 7 of Wands</span></b>

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Work - The Magician</span></b>

2019 brings you all the resources, skills, tools, energy and abilities needed to manifest your dreams and desires. Everything that you need is either within you or right in front of you. All you need, to turn your dreams into reality, is to take massive action. The Magician represents that time in your life when the power of manifestation is at its peak/extreme.

Great opportunities to make extra money and abundance related to finances are coming your way!

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Love - Page of Cups</span></b>

Exciting news and messages of an engagement, a wedding, pregnancy, birth of a baby, a new romance or an offer of a new project from your loved ones will fill you with happiness and joy this year. You might find yourself having unending fantastical crushes and attraction. If you want to turn it into reality, come out of your fantasy world and take determined action with practical measures. If you feel yourself drawn to someone, don‚Äôt hold back! Express yourself and let them know that you are interested. However, remember to guard yourself against being emotionally immature and needy.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">The Bigger Picture - 2 of wands</span></b>

You‚Äôve reached a level of success. Take a moment to reflect on how far you‚Äôve come. Give yourself a pat on the back for all that you‚Äôve achieved. Now look to the future and make further plans. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhere do I want to go next?‚Äù If you‚Äôre planning to travel, the Two of Wands advises: Go!

The 2 of Wands can also symbolize a choice. Examine the two options carefully and go forth with confidence with what you want. Be open to newer ideas or ways of thinking. Don‚Äôt be shortsighted. Look at the bigger picture.

The Bigger Picture

<b><span style="font-size: large;">WORK - 6 of Pentacles</span></b>

2019 signifies a period of equality and fairness in your life. You are well-paid, valued and rewarded for your hard work and efforts. If you are looking for a job or considering a change of career, you will be far more successful than you anticipate. If you are in business, a bank or investors will be interested in investing in your business. Expect generosity, financial support, advice from a powerful business associate or boss. A possible promotion or bonus at work is on the cards. You will have enough wealth and prosperity for yourself. A strong sense of sharing your time, wisdom, knowledge, wealth with people around you will also prevail. At the same time, help and support will be available to you when you need it the most.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Love - 7 of Wands</span></b>

Your relationships may present challenges and hardships. Constant bickering, jealousy and conflict with someone you care about, such as a lover, friend or family member or a rebellious teen, may upset you and create trouble. 7 of Wands says, ‚ÄúIf you believe in something, do everything that is in your power to protect and save it.‚Äù Keep your composure, remain firm and hold your ground. Be very strong in your conviction and don‚Äôt let anybody influence you and ruin what you have. Safeguard yourself. Don‚Äôt hesitate to take help from a relationship or a marriage counselor, if need be.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">The Bigger Picture - 2 of Cups</span></b>

The Two of Cups focuses on relationships, so much of the advice is around tending and caring for your relationships. Since this card calls for unity, try to meet the other person where they are. Cooperation and compromise may help. Remember that relationships are about ‚Äògive and take‚Äô. Share what you have with others. This card also advises you to make an offer (both in romance and other situations, such as buying a house).

If you‚Äôre asking about a potential romance, the Two of Cups says: go for it! There is a spark and attraction that is worth pursuing. Try to connect or reach out.

The Bigger Picture
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Work - 3 of Pentacles</b></span>

You have the skills, capabilities and resources needed to achieve your goals. Put your 100% involvement, dedication, determination, hard-work and commitment to build on success or foundations. Your attention to detail and efforts will pay-off. You will be rewarded and recognized for your efforts and achievements.

Team work, collaborations and associations with important and influential people will help you in accomplishing big objectives. Each person possesses unique skills and capabilities and as a team, they can create something much bigger than what they can do individually. If you are in an organization that doesn‚Äôt provide opportunity for growth and advancement, and you feel your abilities are not being utilized, move on and find an organization that values your talents.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Love - Queen of Wands</span></b>

2019 brings a lot of excitement and enthusiasm. The new year brings in good friends and allies too but do not let over-enthusiasm cloud your judgment. Choose your friends wisely. Treat everyone fairly. Use your sweet, warm and charming nature and focus on making more connections, meeting new people or creating a new community of like-minded people. You will be the centre of attraction wherever you go and people treat you as a celebrity.

With bold and courageous actions and undertakings, undaunting confidence and self-assurance, you can achieve anything that you set mind to. Express your passions with great courage and let no-one silence you.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">The Bigger Picture - 9 of Swords</span></b>

Face your fears and insecurities. If something is bothering you, do not suffer in silence. Don‚Äôt put off taking care of the matter at hand. It would be better to deal with it. Seek help if you can‚Äôt deal with your fears alone.

In other words, the 9 of Swords tell you that what you are worrying about needs your attention. If something is keeping you up at night, eliminate that source of stress.

The Bigger Picture
<b><span style="font-size: large;">WORK - The Fool</span></b>

On the work front, 2019 brings new beginnings, new opportunities and possibilities that are filled with enthusiasm and excitement. There might seem to be some risks involved but the Fool tells you to have complete and total faith in the Universe and take the plunge into a new direction. You will be amazed with the outcome. Let go of all your tensions and worries and embrace the changes with open-mindedness and optimism. The Universe is opening new avenues that will be very beneficial to you. 2019 will bless you with a happy-go-lucky, friendly, enthusiastic and supportive attitude, especially in work-related matters.
<b><span style="font-size: large;">Love - 3 of Swords</span></b>

The 3 of Swords represents challenges in a relationship. In 2019, if you experience pain, heartbreak and hurt in relationships, just check yourself. Are you giving too much? Are you tolerating too much? Are you being over-sensitive? Are you expecting too much? Are being too straightforward in your conversations? Nobody has the power to hurt you unless and until you allow them to. So, 3 of Swords is a wake - up call. Vocalize your needs, set your boundaries, make yourself emotionally stronger. Reclaim your power and don‚Äôt give in to jealousy, hurt or anger.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">The Bigger Picture - 9 of Pentacles</span></b>

The Bigger Picture

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Work - Knight of Cups</span></b>

2019 brings you an upswing in finances and lucrative offers in work and career. Any problems and struggles regarding work can be successfully resolved by thinking outside the box and taking practical measures. Resolve any work-related challenges creatively. Use tact and diplomacy, especially for important deals that need negotiations.

Explore your passions and interests. Pay attention to your emotions, imagination and intuition. At the same time, back them up with practicality to turn your dreams into reality. If you are still searching for a career, you may be drawn to a creative or artistic field.

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Love - 4 of Cups</span></b>

The 4 of Cups indicates discontentment, boredom and monotony in relationships and personal life. This may be because you are being too emotional, sensitive, dispassionate, lacking creativity, true expression, or have unrealistic expectations and fantasies about what your relationship should be like. If this continues, you will miss out on opportunities and options which you will deeply regret later, for sure. So, don‚Äôt ignore potential partners or offers of dates. Appreciate what you have rather than on what you don‚Äôt have. This attitude of gratitude will bring into focus all missed opportunities so you can benefit from them instead of losing them. Make the most of them to acquire the abundance, happiness, contentment and joy that you desire.
<b><span style="font-size: large;">The Bigger Picture - Knight of Cups</span></b>
Stay focused on your vision and let your heart lead you in all matters! Express yourself with complete openness and don‚Äôt hold back.

In your love and relationships, the Knight of Cups calls for courageous, romantic action. Let your feelings guide your every move. Go for experiences that bring joy. Take determined action for something you have always wanted to pursue. The Knight of Cups tells you that you are moving in the right direction.

Be kind, receptive and friendly with your co-workers and colleagues.

This is an extremely fortuitous and fortunate time. By letting your imagination and creativity flow and by exploring new possibilities you can reach your full potential and experience total fulfillment, contentment and success at work.
