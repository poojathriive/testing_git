Hay. This program is about YOU, the way you are, the key influences and events in your life that have brought you to where you are now and the way you would like your life to be. The process of healing your life begins with breaking through the layers of old conditioning and beliefs about how you ‚Äúshould‚Äù lead your life, identifying the problem areas and clearing out emotional clutter connected with them. These programs provide a series of practical steps to make these changes. Some of the benefits of this program are learning to love yourself and others more fully, releasing negative emotions that block your joy and creativity, and working with the body, mind and spirit to transform your life.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1391";s:5:"count";s:2:"14";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:2:"13";}}
