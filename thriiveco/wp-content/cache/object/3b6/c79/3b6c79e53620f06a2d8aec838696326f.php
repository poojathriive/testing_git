But a chest pain rings a danger bell. Chest pain can appear in many forms and can range from a sharp stabbing pain to a dull thud of pain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of different issues can cause chest pain but the most threatening is the one involving the heart or lungs. It is a very critical condition and anything crucial calls for medical help.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, chest pain is related to heart-related issues but there can be many more reasons for it. A few are mentioned below:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Heartburn: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A burning sensation of the stomach acids traveling upwards can create a very discomforting situation resulting in chest pain.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Gallbladder or pancreas problems.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gallstones can cause abdominal pain that radiates to your chest.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Costochondritis:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a condition in which the cartilage of your rib cage becomes inflamed and painful. This is often accompanied by a Vitamin D deficiency.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  </span><b>Sore muscles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic pain syndromes can also produce muscle-related chest pain.</span></li>
