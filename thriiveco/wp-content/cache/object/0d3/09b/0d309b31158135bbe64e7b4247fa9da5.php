Applied Kinesiology is based on the belief that muscles are linked to specific organs and glands, and their weakness indicates problems such as nerve damage, low blood supply, chemical imbalance and other neurological issues. Practitioners diagnose and treat this by correcting the muscle weakness that corresponds to the internal organs. Treatments can range from testing and counseling coupled with deep massage, joint manipulation, acupuncture and dietary therapies.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1391";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"2";}}
