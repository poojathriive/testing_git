A sensor rod held in the hand of the patient collects data on various systems of the body using electrical impulses via ‚Äúskin conductance‚Äù. Health data of 23 parameters is collected within minutes from various body systems. QRMHA replaces the need for ultrasonic, nuclear magnetic resonance or radiography for various health related conditions. Mostly recommended for Primary or Preventive Healthcare.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1503";s:5:"count";s:1:"3";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"3";}}
