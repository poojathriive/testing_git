They are the same as seizure disorders. A person is said to be diagnosed with epilepsy if they have had two episodes of unprovoked seizures. Unprovoked, in the sense, without any reversible condition like alcohol withdrawal or so. Epilepsy could affect a person of all and any age group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The causes of these seizures could be either a severe brain injury or a family history of the disease. But often than not, the cause of the ailment is unknown and remains so. Due to this complexity of the disease and the complications it brings with it, there is little cure available for it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">World Health Organization (WHO) noted, â€œSeizure episodes are a result of excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges. Seizures can vary from the briefest lapses of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. Seizures can also vary in frequency, from less than 1 per year to several per day.â€</span>

<b>Triggers</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In and around the globe, there are tons of unique and often unmanageable triggers causing an epilepsy attack. In Mumbai alone, various epilepsy experts will tell you of very uncommon triggers like urination or crying or so on. When such is the trigger, there is very little you can do. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the medicines available help in only treating these symptoms:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utter confusion in the brain</span></li>

<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under normal circumstances, a dose of antiepileptic medicines could be very helpful in controlling seizures, depending on the trigger that caused it. But doctors will also give you a combination of these medicines in order to treat you better. However, if your condition is a little severe, epilepsy surgery is also available.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€ </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of epilepsy is: </span><b>Sense of persecution. Rejection of life. A feeling of great struggle. Self-violence.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating epilepsy is: </span><b>I choose to see life as external and joyous. I am eternal and joyous and at peace. </b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
