Although trauma is a normal response to horrible events, its after-effect can be so severe that they affect the victimâ€™s ability to live a normal life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to NCIPC, globally, trauma is the number one cause of death among people from age 1â€“46.</span>

<b>Causes Of Trauma</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trauma is usually caused by a serious negative event that results in a long-term impact on the metal and emotional stability of the victim. Even though most traumas are physically-induced, others are psychological. However, the common causes of trauma include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural disaster</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rape</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death of a loved one</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serious illness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Being a prisoner of war</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Sexual abuse as a child</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Symptoms Of Trauma</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the causes and symptoms of trauma vary, there are some general signs of trauma to check out.</span>

<b>Emotionally disorganized</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who just came out from traumatic events usually appear emotionally disorganized. They can be recognized by their shaken and disoriented attitude.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They donâ€™t respond to conversations in a way that a normal person should. They often withdraw from the conversation.</span>

<b>Anxiety</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sign of a victim of a traumatic event is anxiety. Trauma-induced anxiety can be evident in situations such as nightmares, irritability, mood swings, edginess, and lack of concentration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People respond to trauma in various ways. In fact, relatives and friends may not virtually notice the symptoms in some victims.</span>

<b>Treatment Of Trauma</b>

<b>Trauma- Maintain a regular exercise</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A regular 30 minutes exercise daily is good. Rhythmic exercises such as running, walking, basketball or even swimming engages your arms and leg</span>

<b>Add mindfulness components</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than concentrating on the exercise or distracting yourself, concentrate on your body as you move.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boxing, rock climbing, or martial arts are a good example of mindfulness exercise.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several trauma management program options available to victims. Due to the unpredictably varying nature of the condition, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. Each patient has their own individual approach and treatments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first approach is to aid the quick recovery of the physical effects of trauma. Burned skin, broken bones, and other organs that require a specific treatment will be treated before moving over to the psychological healing process.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";}}
