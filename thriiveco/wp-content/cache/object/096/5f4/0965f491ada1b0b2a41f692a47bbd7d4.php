<b>Keeping your heart health</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People with arrhythmia need to keep their heart healthy. And hereâ€™s the best way to do this:</span>

<b>Limit your caffeine intake: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who love coffee or energy drinks should, at least stay conscious of how much they drink. For energy drinks, its best to strictly avoid them.</span>

<b>Reduce alcohol intake: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcohol is known to increase blood pressure which has been linked to Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<b>Stay active: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise improves heart health. It's advisable to choose cardio over weightlifting exercises. As opposed to peopleâ€™s notion, yoga helps to improve the symptoms of Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<b>Shed off some pounds: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most significant steps to take is to shed off some extra weight. Overweight or obese people are at higher risk of having Heart arrhythmias or even other heart related problems. Warning: don't try to lose weight with diet pills; it can cause Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<b>Sleep well for a healthy heart: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping very well prevents the risk of developing the condition. It helps to reduce the stress pressure in the heart. Sleeping period of 7-9 hours in a day is healthy enough.</span>

<b>Don't be nonchalant with your Heart arrhythmias: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While your doctor might tell you that your Heart arrhythmias may not mean any harm, that doesnâ€™t mean it cannot lead to serious cases. It can lead to uncomfortable conditions that you may not be able to live with. Always keep them in check.</span>

<b>Avoid smoking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay clear of smoking. It can cause heart diseases including Heart Arrhythmias.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, you can live a healthy life with arrhythmias. Always maintain your heart health.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œillness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus: </span><b>Longstanding emotional problems. Lack of joy. Hardening of the heart. Belief in strain and stress.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Heart arrhythmia is: </span><b>My heart beats to the rhythm of love</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}}
