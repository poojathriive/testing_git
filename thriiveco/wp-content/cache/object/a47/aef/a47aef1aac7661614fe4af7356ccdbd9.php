Though Tarot Cards were more popular, from 18th to 20th century playing cards were also used. These cards probably originated in China but gypsy travellers were the ones who spread this method of divination across Europe from 14th century onwards. A standard deck might contain a couple of jokers and even a blank card in addition to the 52-card, four-suit set. Each of these cards signifies a particular meaning and the Reader interprets them based on the order they are chosen.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1419";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"1";}}
