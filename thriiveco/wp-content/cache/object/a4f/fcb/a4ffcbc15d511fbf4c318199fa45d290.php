<b>Causes of Gout</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gout occurs due to the formation of urate crystals in the joint, resulting in an intense pain and inflammation. Urate crystals often form when the levels of uric acid in your blood is high.</span>

<b>Risk Factors Of Gout</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you're going to develop gout if your body's uric acid level is high (since high uric acid causes Gout). Some factors that increase the levels of uric acid in the body include:</span>

<b>Diet: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating foods rich in seafood and meat and drinking beverages with sweet fruit sugar may increase the uric acid level, which in turn, triggers the occurrence of gout.</span>

<b>Obesity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the body of overweight people produces more uric acid.</span>

<b>Family history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone in your family has had gout in the past, you could get it too.</span>

<b>Prevention Of Gout</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to prevent gout, the following dietary steps should be taken:</span>

<b>Drink more fluid: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always stay hydrated, especially with plenty of water. Reduce your intake of sweetened beverages.</span>

<b>Stay away from alcohol: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can't, discuss with your doctor about the amount of alcohol considered safe for you.</span>

<b>Reduce your intake of non-vegetarian food:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Follow a vegetarian diet.</span>

<b>Maintain a Normal body weight: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing weight helps reduce your body's uric acid levels.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Gout is: </span><b>The need to dominate. Impatience, anger.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Gout is: </span><b>I am love. I choose to love and approve of myself. I see others with love</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
