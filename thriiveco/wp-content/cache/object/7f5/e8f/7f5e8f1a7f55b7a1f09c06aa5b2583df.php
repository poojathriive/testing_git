We have all heard about migraine which results in nausea, well this is just a notch down. It has been reported that every year more than 100 lakh cases are registered in India for tension headache. This is also the most common type of headache, and yet people have not seen a decline in the number of cases for the same.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, tension headaches are primarily caused by excessive stress. But the actual cause of tension headaches is unknown. Experts came up with a theory which stated tension headaches are stemmed from muscle contractions in the face, neck, and scalp, perhaps as a result of heightened emotions, tension or stress.Â </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But several types of research since then, have suggested that muscle contractions cannot be assumed as the only cause. Increased muscle tenderness, a common symptom of tension headaches, may result from a sensitized pain system, which is also known to cause tension headaches. It is common for some people to develop tension headaches after staring at a computer screen for a long time, or long after driving for long hours.Â </span>
