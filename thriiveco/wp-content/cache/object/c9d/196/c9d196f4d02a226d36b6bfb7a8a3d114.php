<p style="text-align: justify;">I simply must write this. My son had two epileptic seizures the night before last, after I learned that EFT can stop them. I woke to my beautiful son, Elijah, punching me (I gave him permission to do so). He was having a petite mal. I looked him in the eye and told him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make it stop now.‚Äù I began to tap his forehead‚Äîit stopped instantly. He maintained eye contact and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so smart, Dad,‚Äù and went back to sleep. Thank you so much for the work that you do! I look forward to bringing him to your next session to give him the tools to heal completely. ‚Äì Christian K. California</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tapping has helped me overcome an addiction that has plagued me for the last 10 years. I felt like I had tried everything and was in complete despair. I came across it and you less than a month ago and already it has changed my life in so many ways. I feel like I have a tool now which can help me accomplish anything that I set my mind to. To say that I am grateful is an understatement! THANK YOU SO MUCH SONYA SOPHIA! ‚Äì Jessi J. London</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This past weekend, I took a two-day intensive EFT workshop from Sonya Sophia Illig, an advanced EFT practitioner. It deepened my understanding of EFT by direct experience working on myself and by practicing with other participants. Most of all, I walked away with a feeling of peace in every cell of my body. When asked for one word to describe the workshop experience for me, I offered ‚Äúbeingness‚Äù because I felt for the first time in years that I was just being. Many unconscious beliefs and thoughts that had been limiting me were released and in their place was room to just be myself. -Cara G. Ph.D. California</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each session and circle with her is a pleasure: an experience that allows me to heal something within myself, and simultaneously deepen my understanding of EFT. I found a healing technique that could work on any problem: from small, seemingly petty subjects to illnesses deemed chronic and incurable‚Ä¶ It is fast, free and available to all. I found my magic wand! ‚Äì Jon N. UK</p>
