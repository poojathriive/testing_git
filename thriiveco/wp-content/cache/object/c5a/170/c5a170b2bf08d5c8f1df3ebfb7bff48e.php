This goes to explain the severity as well as the urgency to eliminate this lung ailment from the surface of the earth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Health Organization describes TB as, ‚ÄúTuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affects the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it is true that TB generally affects the lungs of a person, it could also affect the brain or bones of an individual, depending on what has caused him the ailment.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incessant and severe coughing</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chest conjunction</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe body pain</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiredness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loss of appetite</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WHO also notes that about one-quarter of the world suffers from latent TB wherein people are infected by the disease but haven‚Äôt yet fallen ill or aren‚Äôt capable of transmitting the ailment. A lot of factors determine the spread of the disease: a weak immune system and frequent consumption of tobacco being two prominent factors. TB is preventable as well as curable too. However, some factors that cause TB make it a little too difficult for the patients to bear the trauma of this sickness. Here are its causes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobacco smoking</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weak immune system</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhaling infected droplets</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living in clustered conditions</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug misuse</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcoholism</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medications for TB have been very useful in getting rid of this pandemic illness. However, with the onset of this century, we were riddled by what we call as the MDR- drug resistant TB. Drug resistant TB is a kind wherein the virus is immune to the effects of the drugs used to treat it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The duration of antibiotic TB will vary depending on the location of the illness and the age, cause and other such factors that led to TB. But a standard medication period is around 6 months.¬†</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of TB is: </span><b>Wasting away from selfishness. Possessive. Cruel thoughts. Revenge</b><b><i>.</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating TB is</span><b>: As I love and approve of myself, I create a joyful, peaceful world to live in.</b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
