This pain can go anywhere from the lower back to the sole of the foot.</span>

<b>Causes of sciatica</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve is pinched, usually when a disk in the spin is herniated or when a bone on the bone spur (vertebrae) overgrows. On rare occasions, the sciatic nerves may be caused by diseases like diabetes.</span>

<b>Symptoms Of Sciatica</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though most people completely recover from Sciatica without treatment, it can permanently damage the nerves.¬†</span>

<b>Below are symptoms to look out for:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No feeling in the affected leg</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakness in the affected leg</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowel or bladder suddenly stops functioning</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Risk factors of Sciatica</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some factors trigger the occurrence of Sciatica. They include:</span>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common cause of Sciatica is age. Age causes changes in the spine such as bone spurs and herniated disks.</span>

<b>Obesity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excess weight on the spine can result in spinal changes which trigger sciatica.</span>

<b>Nature of job: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your job requires you to carry heavy loads, twist your back, or drive a vehicle for a longer time, chances are you may develop Sciatica. However, there‚Äôs no conclusive evidence to back up this observation.</span>

<b>Lengthened sitting: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who spend much time on a seat or live a sedentary lifestyle have higher chances of developing Sciatica unlike active people.</span>

<b>Diabetes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diabetes which affects how the body uses sugar can ultimately damage the nerve.</span>

<b>Prevention Of Sciatica</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs always impossible to prevent sciatica, and there are chances of reoccurrence. The following routinely-based steps can play a significant role in protecting your back:</span>

<b>Regular exercise</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain a strong back, pay close attention to important muscles like those in your lower back and abdomen. They play a key role in postures and alignments.</span>

<b>Maintain a proper sitting posture</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose seats with good armrest, accurate lower back support, and a swivel base.</span>

<b>Practice good body mechanism</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When lifting a heavy object, allow your lower extremities to take charge. If the object is way too heavy, find a lifting partner. Don‚Äôt lift and twist simultaneously.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Sciatica is: </span><b>Being hypocritical. Fear of money and of the future.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Sciatica is: </span><b>I am love. I choose to love and approve of myself. I see others with love</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
