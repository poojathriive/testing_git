It commonly starts with an acute phase of fever, tiredness, headache, and appetite loss. Except in developed countries that have already introduced a vaccine, incidence of mumps around the world has risen to 1000 per 100,000 population.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people infected with the viral disease never noticed a sign or symptoms. Most signs and symptoms typically appear after about 2 to 3 weeks of viral exposure. Mumps can cause swollen salivary glands which puff the cheeks out.</span>

<b>Others symptoms include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle aches</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of appetite</span></li>
</ul>
<b>How is Mumps contracted?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mumps occurs when a contagious virus spreads through the saliva of someone infected. You can easily contract Mumps through the cough and sneezing of an infected person if youâ€™re not vaccinated against the virus. Sharing spoons and cups with an infected person can also cause Mumps.</span>

<b>How To Prevent Mumps</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Get plenty of rest.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To alleviate the spread of the virus, plus to allow your immune system to eliminate the virus, it's advisable to be indoors during symptoms period.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bed rest isn't that important, but taking a reasonable hour of sleep ( 8 to 9 hours) can help.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drink more fluid</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Because mumps causes throat pain and makes chewing and swallowing difficult, most people tend to lose their appetite. To prevent the symptoms from worsening, drink plenty of water (around 8 glasses daily).</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Naturally control the pain. If symptoms worsen, using mild painkillers can reduce the pain and allow you to sleep at night.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use Antiviral herbs which are natural substances derived from a plant. They help to enhance the immune system and stop the spread of the virus.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet consisting of fruits and vegetables helps prevent serious complications that arise from Mumps. Also, foods like berries, leafy greens, sweet potatoes, cooked carrots, all contain protective nutrients.</span></li>
