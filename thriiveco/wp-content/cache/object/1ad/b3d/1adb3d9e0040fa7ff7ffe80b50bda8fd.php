It is caused by different forms of disease and lifestyle pattern such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever the liver is injured, it automatically tries to repair itself. During this process, it forms scars. In the cirrhosis stage, the scars increase and disturb the liver function. The damages done by the liver are irrevocable. Only an early diagnosis of the disease can help in reverting it.</span>

<b>Maintain a healthy weight: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always stay conscious of your weight because body fats may destroy the liver.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Cirrhosis is: </span><b>Resistance to change. Fear, anger, hatred.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Cirrhosis is: </span><b>My mind is clean and free. I leave the past and move into the new. All is well.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
