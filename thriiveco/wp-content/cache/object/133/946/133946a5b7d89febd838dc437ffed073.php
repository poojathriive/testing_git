An estimated 7% of men and 5% of women in the world have sleep apnea. Also, globally, about 100 million people suffer from sleep apnea.</span>

<b>Symptoms Of Sleep Apnea</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loud snoring</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache that occurs only in the morning</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gasping for air during sleep</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trouble with sleeping</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irritability</span></li>
</ul>
<b>¬†</b>

<b>Causes Of Sleep Apnea</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medically, sleep apnea occurs when the muscles located at the end of the throat are relaxed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This relaxed muscle makes your airways narrower whenever you breathe in which reduces the amount of air flowing in. The brain detects your struggle with breathing and rouses you from sleep so the airways can be reopened. The awakening process is so brief that you may not remember it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In some other severe (and rare) form of Sleep Apnea, the brain refuses to send signals to the breathing muscles.</span>

<b>Who can be affected:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sleep disorder can affect anyone, not leaving out children. But a number of factors that trigger its occurrence include:</span>

<b>Obesity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive weight increases the risk of sleep apnea. Fats present in the upper airway can disrupt proper air flow.</span>

<b>Narrowed airway: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with narrow throat (which are often inherited) have a higher risk of sleep apnea.</span>

<b>Male: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibility of males having sleep apnea is twice or thrice that of females. Also, women, after menopause have a higher risk.</span>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep apnea is most common among older adults.</span>

<b>Family history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a family history of sleep apnea might trigger the possibility of having one too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other factors include smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and heart disorder.</span>

<b>Lifestyle changes for the treatment Of Sleep Apnea</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For mild cases of sleep apnea, a change in lifestyle is recommended. They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shed off some pounds</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing weight can open your throat and reduce sleep apnea.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop smoking</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking increases inflammation in the throat. So it's advisable to stop smoking.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using sleeping pills or taking alcohol before sleeping. It disrupts smooth breathing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain Regular Exercise: Regular exercise has a major influence on the quality of sleep. Yoga is also a good practice that will strengthen your airways.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid caffeinated drinks and heavy meals at night.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain a consistent sleep hour. It keeps you relaxed and you sleep better.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedtime steps to reducing sleep apnea</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep on your side</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't sleep on your back. It makes it easier for your soft tissues and tongue to interfere with smooth breathing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move your head up</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raise your bed's head by up to 6 inches. You can also use a cervical pillow for the elevation.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a nasal dilator or nasal irrigation system to keep your nasal passage open at night.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If these steps don't improve your symptoms or if you're suffering from a severe level of apnea, medical treatment might be recommended. There are certain devices that can aid free breathing during sleep. Other forms of treatment include surgery and therapy.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Sleep Apnea is: </span><b>Fear, anxiety, and feeling threatened.¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Sleep Apnea is: </span><b>I lovingly protect myself with thought of joy and peace. The past is forgiven and forgotten. I am free in this moment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}}
