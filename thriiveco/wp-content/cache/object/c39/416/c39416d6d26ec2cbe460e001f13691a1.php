However, everyone cannot access it as it is clouded by the ego mind. One can only access it by allowing oneself the freedom of â€™beingâ€™ and this enables the divine love and compassion to just overflow thereby assisting humans in healing their own bodies, minds and spirit. It is a â€˜Siddhiâ€™ (Spiritual Power) of â€˜Preetiâ€™ (Love and Compassion), one has to go inwards and receive it from oneâ€™s inner Universe.
