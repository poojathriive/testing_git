Iridology is a technique wherein a personâ€™s iris color, pattern and other features are considered to be indicators of his or her systemic health. Iridology practitioners refer to something called the iris chart, where the iris is divided into many sections, each representing a part of the body. Through these charts, they can determine which organs and systems of the body are healthy and which ones are inflamed, distressed or overactive. In accordance with this information, they derive the personâ€™s past medical problems, predict future problems and understand if the body is susceptible to certain diseases.  

In case of sclerology, the vascular patterns and whites in the sclera (the white portion of the eye) are studied to determine the overall health. 

If there is a marking in your sclera for a particular body part, it is also there in the iris in the same area. Hence, sclerology and iridology are complementary techniques.
