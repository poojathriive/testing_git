<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader, and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Hepatitis C is: </span><b>Fear, anger, hatred and resistance to change. The liver is the seat of anger and rage.Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Her affirmation for healing Hepatitis C is: </span><b>My mind is cleansed and free. I leave the past and move into the new. All is well</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
