CristianaÂ Eltrayan<strong>Â </strong>works as a therapist, international holistic speaker and author. Additionally, she often travels for opening and maintaining energy portals along the planet, following the planetary energy lines and also the cosmic rhythms. These works are the result of the inner guidance that the author is receiving regarding these energy works. Her workshops and classes have as a main theme the energetic nourishment, the Taoist emotional intelligence and pranic methods of healing and recalibration, converging to theÂ <strong>consciousness of unity</strong>. Â She combines the ancient knowledge with the modern scientific discoveries, to bring a complex and complete picture onÂ <strong>the unlimited nature of the human potential</strong>.

Since 2009 she has been studying the Pranic nourishment (the possibility of being nourished by energy/chi/mana) and since 2013 she is offering lectures and classes on this subject.Â With her work of the Soul Healing Accademy, she has created several projects, includingÂ theÂ <strong>Pranic Consciousness Summit</strong>Â , the<strong>Â Pranic Festival in Romania</strong>, theÂ <strong>Pranic Consciousness Process</strong>, theÂ <strong>Energy in Harmony</strong>Â holistic educational program for children in schools and more than 14 charity and ecology campaigns calledÂ <strong>Itâ€™s Better with Love</strong>Â .Â She is now also practicing theÂ <strong>Soul Healing â€“ Holistic Therapy</strong>Â â€“ which deals with the balance between body â€“ mind-soul and deprogramming and reprogramming the energy field, and shares her experiences in books, workshops, classes and conferences. She is the author ofÂ  5 books, amongst whichÂ â€œ<strong>The Pranic World Book</strong>â€, which describes her experience with pranic communities and pranic processes.";s:10:"post_title";s:18:"Cristiana Eltrayan";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:18:"cristiana-eltrayan";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2019-10-15 17:57:55";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2019-10-15 12:27:55";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:55:"https://www.thriive.in/?post_type=therapist&#038;p=5413";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:9:"therapist";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
