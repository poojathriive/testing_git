Although the ailments may not be life-threatening, immediate medical attention is imperative.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Atrial fibrillation is common among older adults and may not come with signs or symptoms until physical examination is taken.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in some cases, symptoms may occur, which include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inability to exercise</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dizziness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightheadedness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chest pain</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the following factors can cause Atrial fibrillation:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">High blood pressure</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heart attack</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inherited heart defect</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronary heart disease</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular intake of alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or even certain medications.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Preventive Measures To Take</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain measures can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. These measures, if included in daily routine, will certainly play a huge role in preventing AF. They include:</span>

<b>Avoid eating processed food: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">They contain a high amount of saturated fats, which has been proven to increase the risk of developing heart diseases. They contain a low level of nutrition and can cause obesity.</span>

<b>Eat heart-healthy foods: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such foods comprise a balanced diet with several fruits, vegetables and whole grains.</span>

<b>Consume less salt: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">High blood pressure and hypertension can increase the chances of developing Atrial Fibrillation. That's why you should reduce the level of sodium in the body.</span>

<b>Stay conscious of your weight: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we know, being overweight can cause more harm than good to the body.¬† One of the causes of obesity is sleep apnea which is a major cause of Atrial Fibrillation.</span>

<b>Reduce alcohol intake: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit the amount of alcohol you drink per day. One drink is good for the day.</span>

<b>Drink plenty of water: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always drink enough water to stay hydrated. It helps to prevent Atrial Fibrillation.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Atrial fibrillation is: </span><b>Lack of joy, dealing with issues from anger. Not love.¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of doing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Her affirmation for healing Atrial fibrillation is: </span><b>My heart beats to the rhythm of love</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
