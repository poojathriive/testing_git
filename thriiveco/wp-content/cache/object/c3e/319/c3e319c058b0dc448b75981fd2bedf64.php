It is the period from after your spirit leaves your physical body in the last life to just prior to physical incarnation in this current lifetime. This is a deep hypnotherapy process designed to reconnect with one‚Äôs soul and awaken understanding of one‚Äôs immortal identity. Some of the benefits include losing the fear of physical death and gaining a complete understanding of who you really are with sum total of your past life, reception of the newly-arrived soul, ways spirits connect with and comfort the living, organization of souls and spiritual advancement in the afterlife, meaning of Hell, spirit guides and angels, selection of a new life, soulmates, purpose of life, the birth process and how one can get assistance in connecting souls with other soul teachers and guides, amongst others.,";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1447";s:5:"count";s:1:"9";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"8";}}
