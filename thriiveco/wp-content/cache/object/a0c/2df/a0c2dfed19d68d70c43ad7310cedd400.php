Common colds are usually harmless and may not be severe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide, children younger than 6 years have a higher risk of having common colds. Older adults can also experience two or three colds in a year. On an average, younger children develop up to 8 colds in a year with older adults only having up to 4 colds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people affected by common cold recover within 3 days to a week. However, recovery might take longer in people who smoke. Most symptoms of common colds appear within 3 days of exposure to the virus.¬†</span>

<b>Although the signs and symptoms vary from person to person, the general signs include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cough</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sore throat</span></li>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><b>Risk Factors For Common Cold</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following factors can increase your risk of developing a cold:</span>

<b>Age: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Younger children of age six and below have a higher risk of cold.</span>

<b>Weak immune system: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with chronic illnesses or weak immune system have a higher risk of developing cold.</span>

<b>Season: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both adults and children are likely to develop colds in falls and winters. Nevertheless, common cold can develop at any time.</span>

<b>Smoking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking can cause and in fact, lead to severe cases.</span>

<b>Causes Of Common Cold</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While different types of viruses can cause a cold, rhinoviruses are the most common of them all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These viruses get into the body through the eyes, mouth or nose. They can also spread through air droplets of an infected person whenever they sneeze or cough.</span>

<b>Healthy ways to Prevent Common Cold</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There's no special drug or vaccine to cure a cold, but implementing some lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of contacting cold virus:</span>

<b>Keep your hands clean: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and educate your children on the health importance of a clean hand.</span>

<b>¬†</b>

<b>Disinfect your items: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean your bathroom and kitchen countertop using disinfectant-more importantly, if you have someone with a cold.</span>

<b>Tissues: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tissues whenever you sneeze and cough. Throw away used tissues immediately after use, and wash your hands afterwards.</span>

<b>Drink more fluid: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking plenty of fluids (especially water) is a very important step to take when you have a common cold. Because common cold leads to sweats and runny noses which increase the amount of water you lose, it's important to keep the body hydrated and replace the lost water by drinking more fluid.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink up to eight 250 mL cups daily. However, pregnant women should drink more.</span>

<b>Other fluid options for common cold include:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginger ale</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Herbal tea</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Honey and lemon tea</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginger tea</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of common cold is: </span><b>Too much going on at once. Mental confusion, disorder. Small hurts.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing common cold is: </span><b>I allow my mind to relax and be at peace. Clarity and harmony are within me and all around me</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"8";}}
