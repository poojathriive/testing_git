Dementia is a broad term that categorizes a decline in the cognitive ability of individual that is severe enough to interfere in their day-to-day activity. Memory loss, cognitive loss could well be termed as examples. Alzheimer‚Äôs is the most common form of dementia.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Alzheimer‚Äôs and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI), an organization that helps to manage Alzheimer‚Äôs and other forms of dementia, 4.1 million people in India suffer from dementia and this whopping number is set to double by 2030.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The signs and symptoms of anyone suffering from dementia may vary greatly. However, at least two of the following abilities must be disturbed or ruptured in order to say the person is affected by dementia.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memory</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual perception</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication and language</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning and judgment</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to focus and pay attention</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dementia is caused by the death or severe damage of brain cells. The trigger for the disease could be old age or a severe brain injury. Having said all of this, it is almost impossible for anyone to point at the one cause of dementia. Over the years, doctors have, however, found a way out to control the progression of the disease.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, treating one of the following ailments seems to improve dementia too:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinical depression</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutritional deficiencies</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thyroid issues</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcoholism</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dementia can or cannot be treated depending on the cause of the ailment. For instance, if Alzheimer‚Äôs has been the cause of dementia for an individual, then there are very few chances for it to be reversed. This is because even medications cannot reverse the dead cells. What we can do is, stop the progression of the disease. There are drug therapies or medications available to hinder this progression. Occupational therapy, environment modifying therapies have been said to have their own positives in treating this ailment too.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of dementia disease is: </span><b>A refusal to deal with the world as it is. Hopelessness and anger.¬†¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.¬†</span>
