<b>Improving sleep</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, taking some simple but healthy steps can improve sleep:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid drinking liquids 2-3 hours before sleep so you are not awakened for bladder relief</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep the television and computer out of the bedroom</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid e-devices at least an hour before bedtime.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the same sleep schedule everyday including on weekends</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid after-meals afternoon naps</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercising is important for sleeping well but doing it very close to bedtime over-activates the body and skews up the body-clock</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid smoking, drinking or big, spicy meals at night.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a bedtime ritual: make the bed, dim the lights, maintain a comfortable temperature, wear soothing night clothes, play white sound in the background and so on.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Eat right. Sleep tight.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some foods help keep sleep-snatchers away. Here‚Äôs a list of them:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milk - a small cup of warm milk induces a nice sleepy buzz. It‚Äôs also an instant antidote for acid reflux so all‚Äôs win-win.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy carbs - A couple of whole-wheat crackers or a roti or two can make you hit the sack in a jiffy.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese - contains tryptophan that aids the body to feel relaxed and sleepy (so avoid cheese when you‚Äôve got a heavy work day ahead).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cherries - </span><a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.28.1_supplement.830.9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that drinking two glasses of cherry juice daily gave insomniacs and additional 90 minutes of sleep time. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herbal infusions of chamomile tea, kashmiri kava, valerian root and California Poppy, sipped just before bedtime can give restful sleep.</span></li>

<b>Going beyond the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Insomnia. Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù According to her, the main cause of </span><b>Insomnia is </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Fear. Not trusting the process of life. Guilt. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Insomnia is</span><b>: </b><b>¬†</b><b><i>I love and approve of myself and I trust in the process of life. I am safe. ¬†</i></b>
