<span style="font-weight: 400;">Swine Flu spread all around the globe like an epidemic in 2009-2010. It is the name of the influenza type A virus that affects swine (pigs). However, during this epidemic, it spread as a combination of swine and bird flu along with a mixture of human genes. In this case, it came to be known as H1N1. Today, it is included in the flu vaccine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that H1N1 affected nearly 61 million people in the USA and caused 12,469 deaths. All along the globe, 575,400 people died due to swine flu.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The signs and symptoms of H1N1 are as follows:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Fever</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Chills</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Sore throat</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Body pain</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Cough</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Vomiting</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Nausea</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Running nose</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Headaches</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Red, watery eyes</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Diarrhea</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Fatigue</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Causes</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the myths about swine flu is that it can spread through eating pork. This is obviously not true. Influenza viruses affects your cells that line the nose, throat and lungs. The virus enters your body when you inhale contaminated droplets or take in live virus from a contaminated surface through your eyes, nose or mouth.</span>

<b>Foods to eat</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A nutritionally balanced diet could be your savior in most cases. Building a strong immune system will be your key to evading swine flu. Things you must eat include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Foods rich in protein like beans, nuts, soy foods, milk.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Vitamin A- rich foods like those that you get from orange and green coloured fruits and vegetables.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Vitamin C-rich foods like peppers, peas, citrus fruits.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Iron rich foods like dates, spinach, jaggery.Â </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Cloves and raw garlic have proven to be effective too.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Cinnamon and Honey mixture could put up a good fight against swine flu.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like any other flu, H1N1 can be treated through antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Relenza. These medicines do not cure the illness but help in shortening the duration of symptoms or help in making the symptoms less severe.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative therapies like Ayurvedic supplements, particularly consumption of Echinacea, naturopathy, reiki, massage (to treat body pain), yoga, meditation, acupressure and Chinese medicines have proven to be quite helpful too.Â Â </span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
