It is an infection that infects the liver resulting in severe illness. Globally, over 1.4 million cases of Hepatitis A are treated every year. Unlike other types of Hepatitis, Hepatitis A does not lead to chronic liver disease but can cause acute liver failure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs and symptoms of Hepatitis A do not typically appear until after 12-15 days of infection. </span><b>Some signs and symptoms include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue</span></li>

 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint pain</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Contaminated foods and water are the main causes of the infection. Although, a few cases have been linked to sexual intercourse with an infected person, the disease can never be contacted through sneezing or coughing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Hepatitis A vaccine is provided by the government to combat the infection of the virus, it‚Äôs still important to take precautions in order to prevent its spread.</span>

<b>Going beyond the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Hepatitis A is, feeling unloved, refusal to nourish oneself. Putting everyone else first. One of the ways of doing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Her affirmation for healing Hepatitis A is: </span><b>I embrace and trust life knowing that I am safe and loved. I choose to love and be loved</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
