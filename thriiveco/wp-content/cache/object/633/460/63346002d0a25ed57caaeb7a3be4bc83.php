It is recognized as a major form of Asian Bodywork Therapy.

It works through the use of gentle yet deep finger pressure on specific acu-points and verbal Body Focusing techniques. The therapists are non-judgemental and do not force a release. They listen to the clientâ€™s body, allowing it to direct them to areas that need attention and to dictate the pace of the session. The therapists also recognize that the mind, body and
spirit are all connected and that physical tension may indicate emotional trauma or hidden memories. They direct the client's awareness to the muscle tension and encourage them to release it through processing their emotions.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1475";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"1";}}
