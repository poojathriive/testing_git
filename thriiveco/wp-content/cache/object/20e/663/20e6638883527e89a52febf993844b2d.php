We come across various people, things, and food in our day-to-day life and hence picking up a virus is not a rare scenario. Urticaria or hives is a common skin ailment. It is a condition in which the skin breaks out in red bumps that may appear suddenly, either as a result of the body's reaction to a certain something, or for unknown reasons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Urticaria is commonly known as hives and usually cause itching, but may also burn or sting. They vary in size and may join together to form larger areas known as plaques. They can last for hours, or even days before fading.</span>

<b>What Causes Urticaria?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Allergic Hives form in response to histamine, a chemical released from specialized cells along the skin's blood vessels. There are various reasons for Histamineâ€™s release but a few major reasons are:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hives lasting more than six weeks are known as Chronic Hives. The cause of this type of hives is usually more difficult to identify. According to Allergist Stanley Fineman, â€œHives usually are caused by other things besides infection, although it could be from a virus. It could also be from a hormonal change and Â even could be emotional in some situations.â€â€‚â€‚â€‚</span>
