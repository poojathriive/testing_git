<b>Home remedy</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-care is the most important tool to prevent or cure a stomach flu. Given below are some precautionary methods one can take:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â </span><b>Â </b><b>Get ample rest:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fatigue and excessive lethargy are main symptoms of stomach flu. Give your body ample rest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><b>Drink plenty of fluids:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One mistake a lot of people make during watery motions is to avoid drinking fluids. This could lead to dehydration. Make sure you have plenty of water and adults can also have ORS (Electral) or GluconD.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><b>Eat right: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consume right kinds of food to get better. Have boiled starches like rice, potatoes, oats and plain cereals with salt. You could try having bananas, soup and boiled veggies. Have something as light as curd-rice to give ease to your stomach. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">4)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><b>Avoid heavy meals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Meals that put stress on your digestive system needs to be restricted or avoided. Non-vegetarian food, ghee or beans are examples of foods that are heavy on the stomach.</span>

<b>Treatment</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no specific medical treatment for stomach flu. Most medicines will help to relieve your symptoms. Antibiotics donâ€™t help you with viruses and overusing them could contribute to making the viruses resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, self-care is your strongest weapon against stomach flu.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€ </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of stomach problems like gastritis is: </span><b>Prolonged uncertainty. A feeling of doom. Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating gastritis is: </span><b>I love and approve of myself. I am safe.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative therapies that could help you include reiki, naturopathy, acupressure, acupuncture, herbal supplements or therapy, Ayurveda, homeopathy, yoga, and meditation.</span>

<b> 9)</b> <b>VARICOCELE</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Varicose veins is a condition that occurs in the legs. Varicocele is nothing but varicose veins that occur in the scrotum area. This occurs due to the malfunction or enlargement of certain veins in the scrotum area. During puberty, thereâ€™s a growth spurt and more blood is needed by the testicles. Sometimes, blood can get accumulated in the veins inside the scrotum, causing them to enlarge, thereby creating varicocele. This mostly tends to happen on the left side. Varicocele forms between the ages of 15-25 years and affect approximately 15 percent of males. The condition could impact male fertility.</span>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Varicocele is generally not painful but its symptoms could worsen with time. Here are few indicators to watch out for:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lump</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swelling in the scrotum that feels like a â€œbag of wormsâ€</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change in the size, shape or appearance of the scrotum</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fertility problems</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain in the scrotum region due to physical exertion or standing for long hours.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testicle shrinkage/ malfunction</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vein dysfunction</span></li>
</ul>
<b>What to eat?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that varicocele mostly occurs during the wake of puberty, it is important to eat the right foods for curing varicocele and also getting healthier. Hereâ€™s what you should eat and avoid:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">â€˜Whole- foodsâ€™: This includes whole, healthy foods like vegetables and fruits.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fibre-rich foods: Have loads of foods which are high in fibre. Be it fruits or vegetables, opt for those with fibre like banana and radish.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flax seeds</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â Â Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid: Processed food, caffeine, junk foods, alcohol and excess sugar.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatment</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things that your doctor will tell you is to wear a loose underwear. Wearing a very tight vest could prove to be painful and cause a lot of other ailments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most men with varicocele never actually undergo a treatment because it doesnâ€™t cause pain. However, if you suffer from atrophy or infertility, you may want to undergo a treatment. Surgery is one of the most commonly opted-for treatment methods in this case as it repairs the veins so that the blood flows normally.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kegel exercises are also recommended to improve blood flow and muscle tone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Percutaneous </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">embolization is another method of treatment that your doctor may recommend. Here, the radiologist inserts a tube into a vein in the scrotum region to correct the malfunction.</span>
