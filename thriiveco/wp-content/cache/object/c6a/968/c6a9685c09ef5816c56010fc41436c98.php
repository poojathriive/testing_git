Our food habits, our sleeping patterns and not to forgot our stress levels are on a hike in the modern world. On one hand, it is making our lives easier but on the other, it is leaving us with various troubles. A result of this lifestyle is common viruses called Human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes Warts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Warts are non-cancerous skin growths that appear when the top layer of the skin is infected, cut or damaged. Most warts clear up without treatment. However, if they do not disappear, medical help is available.</span>

<b>A few of them are mentioned below:</b>

<b>Salicylic acid:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Over-the-counter creams, gels, paints, and medicated Band-Aids are the most common to remove warts.</span>

<b>Cryotherapy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Freezing liquid, often nitrogen, is sprayed onto the wart, destroying the cells that develop a blister which eventually falls off in a week or so.</span>

<b>Cantharidin:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In this process, doctors may apply an extract from an insect called a blister beetle and other chemicals to warts. The area is then covered with a bandage, which creates a blister that lifts the wart from the skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, </span><b>Warts are Little expressions of hate and A belief in ugliness.</b> <b>Plantar Warts: Anger at the very basis of your understanding. Spreading frustration about the future</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing for Warts is:</span><b> I am the love and the beauty of life in full expression.</b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
