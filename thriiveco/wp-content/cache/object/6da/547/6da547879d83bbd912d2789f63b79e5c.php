Pranayama also balances the prana in the right and left hemispheres of the body and cleanses the nadis of blocks to stimulate a smoother flow of energy. The yogis taught that the mind and breath are intimately connected; our state of mind affects our breathing and similarly breathing can help change oneâ€™s state of mind. And so by mastering the breath one can gain mastery of the mind.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1535";s:5:"count";s:2:"28";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:2:"25";}}
