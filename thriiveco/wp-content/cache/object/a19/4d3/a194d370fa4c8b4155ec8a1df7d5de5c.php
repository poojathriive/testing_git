It acts as a central storehouse for every thought, word, emotion, intent and event felt by every soul since the beginning of Time. The knowledge, in subtle form, exists fluidly between the different realms of time (past, present and possible future) and can be accessed by an Akashic Records Reader through a deep meditative state. The Reader is trained to recognize and draw out the right information based on the seekerâ€™s query. The collective wisdom of the Akashic Records can be tapped into to know oneâ€™s soul-purpose and to heal karmic patterns, dis-ease in the body or any mental or emotional pain.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1419";s:5:"count";s:2:"11";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:2:"11";}}
