But it is true that smoking can greatly compromise the quality of life - not just that of the smoker but also that of those who are around them. Smoking is in fact one of the main causes of a breathing condition called Emphysema, especially for those who are genetically susceptible.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emphysema is a condition in which the breathing tubes in the lungs are narrowed and the air sacs are stretched and damaged due to excessive smoking or passive smoking.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emphysema is a form of COPD. Chronic Bronchitis, which is another form of COPD, differs from Emphysema in that a lot of mucus is formed in Chronic Bronchitis while Emphysema is mainly characterised by shortness of breath even while doing the simplest of works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span><b>The main causes of emphysema are:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  Cigarette smoking</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  Marijuana smoking</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  Air pollution</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Â  Chemical fumes and dust</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Smoke from cooking indoors</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It usually starts with shortness of breath which can lead to bigger problems. You might just ignore it considering it to be your age or health status but it affects your oxygen intake levels and hence your bloodstream. Emphysema makes it hard to catch your breath even after doing the easiest of jobs. Most people with emphysema also suffer from chronic bronchitis. (Search Bronchitis and COPD)</span>

<b>Â A few preventive measures one can take are:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Avoid passive smoking</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Wear a mask to eliminate dust and air pollution</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Exercise and try Yoga therapies to improve breathing</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatment</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Damaged lungs cannot be repaired (in some cases surgery or even lung transplant could be needed). Inhalers could be prescribed or even direct oxygen depending on the severity of the condition.</span>

<b>Lifestyle changes that can give some relief from Emphysema:</b>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quit smoking</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow a healthy diet</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get some exercise everyday</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep fully hydrated - have warm water throughout the day - this will keep the airway free by loosening the mucus.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When going out into the cold air, cover your nose and mouth with a scarf.</span></li>
</ol>
<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<b>Â </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, cause of Emphysema is </span><b>Fear of taking in life. Not worthy of living.Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing for Emphysema is</span><b>: It is my birthright to live fully and freely. I love life. I love me.Â </b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
