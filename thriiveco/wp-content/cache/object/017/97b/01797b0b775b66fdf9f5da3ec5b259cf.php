A mixture of both Eastern and Western energy therapies, Polarity Therapy believes that an electromagnetic energy field surrounds the body and moves between its poles (positive, negative and neutral). The energy centers are based on the Ayurvedic chakras and the Traditional Chinese Medicine principle of yin and yang. Any blockage to the smooth and balanced flow of this energy causes dis-ease in the body. The Human Energy Field is affected by diet, touch, exercise, relationships and life experience. Polarity Therapy works on the principle of balancing these effects through bodywork, touch, exercises, counseling and nutritional advice.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1391";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"2";}}
