Practiced by Shamans in the Amazon and Andes, Munay-Ki is a series of nine rites of initiation performed on those who wish to transform into someone who has access to their inner power and achieve complete wisdom. The energetic transformation through these rites re-inform our body energy and facilitate the healing of past wounds. They also raise vibrations and transform our DNA, giving rise to an entirely new person. The nine rites are- Hampe or rite of healing, Chumpi or bands of power, Ayni or rite of harmonization, Kawak or rite of visionary, Pampa mesayok or guardian of the day, High mesayok or guardian of wisdom, Kurak akuyek or guardian of the Earth, Mosok or rite of Porvenir and Taitanchis Rantis or rite Creator.
