It is a long term condition that can lead to severe disability, although can be mild in some cases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world, approximately 2.5 million people have Multiple Sclerosis. According to research, the proportion of women with Multiple Sclerosis is doubled that of men with the condition. The prevalence typically increases in areas further north and south from the equator. However, continents such as Africa, Asia, and America have exceptionally low levels of MS.</span>

<b>Causes of MS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What causes MS is unknown. It occurs when the immune system of the body fights its own tissues. Why MS develops in some people and not in others still remains a mystery.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it appears that a combined effort of environmental and genetic factors may be responsible.</span>

<b>The following factors can trigger the occurrence of Multiple Sclerosis:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Age- MS occurs at any age, but typically between 16 and 55 years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex-Â  As mentioned earlier, women are more susceptible to Multiple Sclerosis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Family history- If your parents or siblings have had in the past, chances are you may get it too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Infections- Some viral infections have been linked to Multiple Sclerosis.Â </span>

<b>Treatment Of MS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no specific treatment for MS. Typically, treatment focuses on quick recovery, lowering the effect of the disease and managing its symptoms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicine and physical therapy are good ways to strengthen muscles, reduce stiffness, and increase flexibility.</span>

<b>Diets that help with MS</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, people suffering from MS need a diet containing low-fat and high-fiber.Â </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diets low in saturated fats and high in omega 3 fatty acid</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin D and Biotin</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People also need to make healthy food choices such as legumes, and vegetables.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the main cause of Multiple Sclerosis is: </span><b>Mental hardness, hard-heartedness, iron will, inflexibility.Â </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Multiple Sclerosis is: </span><b>It is easy for me to reprogram the computer of my life. All of my life is change and my life is ever new.</b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
