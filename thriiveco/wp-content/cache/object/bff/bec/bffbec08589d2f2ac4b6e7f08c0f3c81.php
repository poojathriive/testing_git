Or say, the â€˜puff or asthalinâ€™ a lot of children carry to school? These are children or people who have breathing problems as a result of asthma. Around the globe, roughly 2,50,000 die of asthma every year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Asthma is a condition of the bronchial tubes or the airways to the lungs. The ailment causes inflammation or swelling in the bronchial tubes and can make you breathless. Asthma is pretty common and those with asthma do not ever get fully cured, but the disease can be managed very well now. Extremely emotional events could also lead to asthma attacks.</span>

<b>Types</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many types of asthma, depending on their onset and severity. Some of them are:</span>

<b>Childhood asthma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is an intermittent form of asthma and reportedly, more children experience asthma attacks than elders. Second-hand smoke, cigarette exposure could be reasons for developing childhood asthma.</span>

<b>Adult-onset asthma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Asthma can begin at any age. Adult-onset asthma could be a result of other ailments too. For example, obesity is a major risk factor.</span>
