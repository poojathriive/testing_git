</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A carbuncle is usually a red, swollen, and painful cluster of boils which are connected to each other under the skin. Carbuncle is not a single boil but rather a collection of them. A boil is an infection of a hair follicle that has a small collection of pus under the skin. They are often found on the back of the neck, shoulders or thighs.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually single, a Carbuncle is most likely to occur on hairy areas of the body such as the back or nape of the neck. But it is common for a Carbuncle to develop in other areas of the body such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, and armpits. They are filled with pus, growing larger and more painful until they rupture and drain out. Occasionally, people feel unwell and experience fever and chills.</span>

<b>Symptoms:¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A carbuncle usually has one or more openings that drain pus onto the skin. The most common cause of a carbuncle is a bacterium known as Staphylococcus Aureus.¬†</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Fever</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nauseous¬†</span></li>
</ol>
<b>Causes:¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria live on the skin and inside the nose and throat. Generally, the body's immune system keeps it under control, but sometimes they enter the skin through a hair follicle, or through a cut in the skin.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the skin gets infected, the immune system responds by sending white blood cells to the affected area to destroy the bacteria. The Pus that you see is an accumulation of dead bacteria, dead white blood cells, and dead skin. Carbuncle occurs in places which are prone to hair, sweat, and friction, and they tend to start in a hair follicle.¬†</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Diabetes: High levels of blood sugar, or glucose, can reduce the immune system's ability to respond to infection with effectiveness.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Medications: Overdosing of medications weaken the immune system.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HIV and some other diseases: Certain conditions take a toll on the immune system.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Skin Conditions: Psoriasis, Eczema, and Acne increase susceptibility to Carbuncle.</span></li>
</ol>
<b>Treatments:¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctors may use a sterilized needle to cut open the boil, which means pricking it and draining the pus away. This is not advised to be done at home, but by the hands of a professional with proper training and equipment. Hot packs and lancing are usually sufficient to get rid of them, but if the infection spreads to a deeper layer under the skin, antibiotics are most likely to be recommended.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path-breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù According to her, the main cause of carbuncle is: Poisonous anger about personal injustices</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness. Her affirmation for treating carbuncle is:</span><b> I release the past and allow the love to heal every area of my life.</b>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
