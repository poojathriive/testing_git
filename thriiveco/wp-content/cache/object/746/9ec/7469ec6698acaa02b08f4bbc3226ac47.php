ALFA, a system based on measuring the pulse variability synchronised with the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has a direct connection to the nervous system, by the sinus node. Frequencies from the HRV are shown as ECG and RR-intervals. Measuring the pulse provides an image of the bodyâ€™s various divisions over the spectrum as well as the synchronization of each division with each other.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1503";s:5:"count";s:1:"0";}}
