Need we explain about how there has been a spike in cases of obesity among children and youth? All that junk foods we gobble down and the lack of exercise has caused more harm than anything else.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study focusing on how the world is becoming obese. The pan-global research analyzed nearly 68 million people through 1980 to 2015 and found that 12 per cent of adults and 5 per cent of children could be classified as â€˜obese.â€™ Thatâ€™s how severe the ailment is.</span>

<b>Causes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for obesity may seem rather obvious to us. Here are some of the many reasons leading to obesity:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Genetics</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Junk food</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Lack of physical exercise</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Chronic stress</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Certain medications like antidepressants, insulin etc.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Hormone imbalance</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Excessive sugar consumption</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What one should clearly understand is that fixing the causes could be of great help. In the current scenario, childhood obesity is a major problem for us to deal with. Children should be tested and evaluated for genetic as well as hormonal imbalances. Once they are diagnosed positive to any of these, they can be well directed to medications.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bariatric treatment, surgery or medications could be a good option. However, we suggest you opt for a healthy lifestyle to see if that helps:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Exercise regularly: Something as simple as walking, jogging or cycling could help in the long run.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Play outdoor games like badminton, cricket or football that can help in some family indulgence time also.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Avoid sugary foods.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Say no to junk foods. Junk is actually what the name suggests, junk. It needs to be controlled and if possible, eliminated from your regular diet completely.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â  Â  Reduce stress.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Hay, motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done path breaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, â€œIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.â€Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her,Â  obesity is caused due to: </span><b>An inherent fear, need for protection and running away from feelings, insecurity, seeking fulfilment, and self-rejection.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations. Doing this regularly can help to reduce the debilitating effects of this illness.Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for treating obesity is: </span><b>I am at peace with my own feelings. I am safe where I am. I create my own security. I love and approve of myself</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from medications, alternative therapies could be of great help too. Some of these are Nutritional therapy, herbal therapy, acupressure, acupuncture or hydrotherapy too.Â </span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:2:"56";}}
