It utilizes subtle inputs to the body known as moves, stimulating the body to heal itself, often profoundly. The practitionerâ€™s moves deliver signals to the nervous system at specific locations (on muscles, tendons, ligaments, or nerves), and the body responds in its own time, within its vital capacity. It provides relief for many types of injuries and health problems, both acute and chronic, and is appropriate for people of all ages, in all degrees of health.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1475";s:5:"count";s:1:"4";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"4";}}
