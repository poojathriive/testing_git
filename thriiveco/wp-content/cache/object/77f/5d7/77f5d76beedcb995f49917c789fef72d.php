Globally, Arthritis is a form of joint disease and is the leading cause of disabilities among Older Adults. Newborn and children are not left out. In fact, annually, over 300,000 newborn and children in the world have it. In 2019, the number of people expected to have arthritis is estimated to be around 78 million. There are two types of Arthritis: Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis.¬†</span>

<b>Rheumatoid Arthritis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder which can affect more than the joints. In fact, for some, this condition can result in the damage of other parts of the body system, including the eyes, skin, lungs, and blood vessels.</span>

<b>Symptoms¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warm, tender, swollen joints</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stiffness of the joints- generally worse early in the morning or after a long time of idleness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever, fatigue, and appetite loss</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Risk factors</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that may increase the chances of rheumatoid arthritis include age, sex, smoking, and family history.</span>

<b>Osteoarthritis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent type of arthritis that affects millions of people from all over the world. This form of arthritis occurs when the protective cartilage at the edges of the bone wears out.</span><b>¬†</b>

<b>Symptoms</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of Osteoarthritis typically develop slowly and become worse over time. They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stiffness</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenderness</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Lifestyle changes to tackle Arthritis</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat a healthy diet that contains antioxidants to prevent inflammation</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain an exercise regimen to keep the joints flexible</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also make sure you‚Äôre not overweight as that tends to put more pressure on the knee joints</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow good sleeping habits so you get adequate, good quality rest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meditation can help one calm down and also visualise healing.</span>

<b>Going beyond in the holistic approach</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional western methods are widely used for treating Arthritis, Louise Hay, Motivational leader and empowerment coach who has done pathbreaking work in supporting HIV/AIDS patients and their families, has said that, ‚ÄúIllness however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.‚Äù</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Louise Hay, the main cause of Arthritis is:</span><b> Criticism, feeling unloved, bitterness, and resentment.¬†</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways of healing this is through saying or writing affirmations.¬†</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her affirmation for healing Arthritis is: </span><b>I am love. I choose to love and approve of myself. I see others with love</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>";s:6:"parent";s:1:"0";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";}}
