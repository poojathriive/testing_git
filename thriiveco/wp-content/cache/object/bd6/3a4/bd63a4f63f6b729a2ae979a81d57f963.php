Fire has the ability to exist in the physical realm as well as carry, release and move energy into the subtler etheric realms. In combination with some mantras, fire can tend to be the strongest of all elements in manifesting intentions, completing karmas and releasing energy into the realms beyond. Candle Magick can be used to improve any areas of oneâ€™s life: personal growth, professional struggles, relationships and old karma or letting go of energy patterns.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1419";s:5:"count";s:1:"4";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"4";}}
