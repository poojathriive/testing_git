Yin Yoga is a passive form of yoga that aims to bring physical, energetic and mental balance through variations of seated and supine poses typically held for 3 to 5 minutes, accessing deeper layers of fascia. This practice is designed to help you sit longer, and more comfortably, in meditation by stretching connective tissue around the joints (mainly the knees, pelvis, sacrum, and spine). itâ€™s a supplemental practice to active forms of exercise. Yin Yoga was originally introduced by Paulie Zink.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1410";s:5:"count";s:2:"17";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:2:"13";}}
