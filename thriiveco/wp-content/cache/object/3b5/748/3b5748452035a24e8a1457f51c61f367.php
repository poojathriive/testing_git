I went to Latika Narang for her full body scan to get a detailed understanding of how my body is performing and what all precautions I should take.

Not only was I told about each and every functionality aspect of my body, the team studied my report of 2 days understanding how my body functioned to a cellular level.

They helped me identify traits for my body type that will help in a better and more wholesome life.";}s:5:"ref_2";a:1:{i:0;s:1509:"Bhanu Pratap Pangtey
I was given mixed opinions about Regression Therapy from friends and so was unsure and skeptical about it.  However, my experience with Latika Mam was blissful  I thought I would be hypnotized and would not know what was happening, contrary I was aware of my being where I was and yet in a sort of dream state. I was worried about becoming emotional & vulnerable but the session intense yet in the end I was very calm & I was feeling very safe

The session lasted for about 2.5 hours and I guess as I lost the sense of time as I drifted into my younger childhood days as well as into one past with Latika Mam guiding me throughout the session. It was interesting that I took all the decisions through the sessions, which gave me a sense of empowerment during the session itself!
When the session ended I was awake, bit emotional and yet I felt free as I used to feel when I was a kid in school and the last class bell would ring, the same feeling of ‚ÄùSchool is over!‚Äô‚Äô I was feeling very light & I was more like I am more complete or I was in bliss.  

Now after two sessions, I am constantly recommending Regression Therapy, to people who feel that they are stuck in their personal or professional Life. I would also like to suggest it for people who are suffering from psychological states such as depression or anxieties. It can also really help people who have suffered loss in their family or have suffered any kind of trauma physiological, psychological or accidents.
