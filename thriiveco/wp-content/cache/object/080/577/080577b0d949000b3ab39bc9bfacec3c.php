The communication can happen with the pet that has passed, to help their owner cope with their grief and/or guilt. In living pets, this therapy helps to heal and remove energetic blocks that are causing an illness. This method also helps to soothe the animal through discomforting situations such as relocations, behavioural problems and in dire circumstances, to know if the animal wants to be euthanized due to terminal illness or grave injury. Animal communication involves the use of the petâ€™s photograph for the telepathic healing.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1419";s:5:"count";s:1:"6";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:1:"6";}}
