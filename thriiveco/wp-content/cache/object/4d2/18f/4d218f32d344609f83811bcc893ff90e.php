This therapy can be likened to performing acupressure on the ear and traces back its roots to traditional Chinese medicine. It involves activating points on the skin of the outer ear or â€˜auricleâ€™ for healing as the ear is considered to be a micro-map of the entire body, representing all body parts. Consequently, any body ailment can be healed by means of the external ear. It is highly effective in treating pain, addictions, internal disorders and emotional issues.
