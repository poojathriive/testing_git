Mindfulness helps individuals become aware of and experience the present moment and empowers them with response-ability. Being mindful in every action or being present in every moment can help one connect with oneâ€™s true nature, which is simply â€˜beingâ€™. Most people live either in regret of the past or worry of the future but the past and future are both like dreams, so becoming mindful roots one in the present â€˜Nowâ€™ moment. Doing this opens up the universe of opportunities to make the most of oneâ€™s life and find meaning and happiness.";s:6:"parent";s:4:"1491";s:5:"count";s:2:"28";s:8:"COUNT(*)";s:2:"13";}}
