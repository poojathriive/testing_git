It is a wind instrument, where the player blows air into a long hollow pipe normally made of wood. It was traditionally played during ceremonial and shamanic processes. A didgeridoo is one of the few instruments that produce a sound that is naturally amalgamated and has a direct impact upon the positive functioning of the body and mind.
