    <i>In the "Varied image responses" mode, WebP Express creates redirection rules for images, such that a request for a jpeg will
        result in a webp &ndash; but only if the request comes from a webp-enabled browser.
        If a webp already exists, it is served immediately. Otherwise it is converted and then served.
        Note that not all CDN's handles varied responses well (see FAQ).

        <p>
            Benefits of not varying image responses:
            <ol>
                <li>CDN's will not have to be set up to forward the Accept header</li>
                <li>Better HIT ratio on CDNs, if the CDN had to be configured to vary on the whole Accept header.</li>
                <li>If a user downloads an image, it will not have wrong file extension</li>
            </ol>
            PS: This mode also works great with <a target="_blank" href="https://da.wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler/">Cache Enabler</a>. Instructions are found in the FAQ.
        </p>
        <p>
            PPS: Images refererenced from external CSS or added dynamically with javascript will not be served as webp in this mode.
