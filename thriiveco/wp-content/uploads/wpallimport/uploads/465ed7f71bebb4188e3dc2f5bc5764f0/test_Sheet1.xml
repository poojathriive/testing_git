		<content><![CDATA[I am often introduced as  a contemporary spiritual facilitator,  writer and energy worker  reaching out in various ways – but these are simply terms to be used -  as I see myself more as a fellow traveler on the path with those on the journey to Self. A deep spiritual font that spontaneously opened up within me in 2001/2 is the very core from where all the work that happens through a ‘me’ continues to stem. My reaching out also ‘happened’ spontaneously, and I truly feel it is Grace that allows ‘me’ to  receive this intuitive understanding, but even more Grace that i can enable fellow travelers on the path too.  

This spiritual foundation is currently expressed through several modalities: Tarot readings and Tarot workshops; Dr Bach remedies healing and Dr Bach remedies workshops; Theta meditative healing sessions and of course Spiritual discourses, Spiritual counseling, and Meditation groups – and these days - face book satsangs!
 
Tarot is taught from the larger macroscopic point of view, where divination is not viewed in only terms of predictions but optimally in ‘Knowing Thyself. The workshop opens up an enchanting world of symbols for each one to endlessly explore, and in that to harness their positive energies! This in-depth exploration of Tarot allows it to be used in a gamut of ways:  as a spiritual journey/guidance, a counseling tool to 'know thyself' or the more layman practical guidance that we need time to time.

Dr Bach Remedy workshops also share both the practical and deeper aspects.  I truly believe that just like authentic spiritual teachers help you to reach your own inner guru - Dr Bach’s remedies allow you to be your and your family’s own best healer – emotionally, spiritually or even physically.    It is one of the simplest and practical systems to learn and use - a handy tool kit during phases of minor or major upsets that every family goes through or as an energy tweak towards ones spiritual ripening.

Personal sessions (Tarot, Bach and Theta meditative healing) are on prior appointment. 


It's not our words that impact another 
But their truth 
It's not our Knowledge that draws another
But it's energy field
It's not Divyaa who reaches out 
But Consciousness
It's not you that I touch
But That I Am 

Love from my heart to yours
