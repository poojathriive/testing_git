,Divyaa Kummar,"I am often introduced as  a contemporary spiritual facilitator,  writer and energy worker  reaching out in various ways – but these are simply terms to be used -  as I see myself more as a fellow traveler on the path with those on the journey to Self. A deep spiritual font that spontaneously opened up within me in 2001/2 is the very core from where all the work that happens through a ‘me’ continues to stem. My reaching out also ‘happened’ spontaneously, and I truly feel it is Grace that allows ‘me’ to  receive this intuitive understanding, but even more Grace that i can enable fellow travelers on the path too.  

This spiritual foundation is currently expressed through several modalities: Tarot readings and Tarot workshops; Dr Bach remedies healing and Dr Bach remedies workshops; Theta meditative healing sessions and of course Spiritual discourses, Spiritual counseling, and Meditation groups – and these days - face book satsangs!
 
Tarot is taught from the larger macroscopic point of view, where divination is not viewed in only terms of predictions but optimally in ‘Knowing Thyself. The workshop opens up an enchanting world of symbols for each one to endlessly explore, and in that to harness their positive energies! This in-depth exploration of Tarot allows it to be used in a gamut of ways:  as a spiritual journey/guidance, a counseling tool to 'know thyself' or the more layman practical guidance that we need time to time.

Dr Bach Remedy workshops also share both the practical and deeper aspects.  I truly believe that just like authentic spiritual teachers help you to reach your own inner guru - Dr Bach’s remedies allow you to be your and your family’s own best healer – emotionally, spiritually or even physically.    It is one of the simplest and practical systems to learn and use - a handy tool kit during phases of minor or major upsets that every family goes through or as an energy tweak towards ones spiritual ripening.

Personal sessions (Tarot, Bach and Theta meditative healing) are on prior appointment. 


It's not our words that impact another 
But their truth 
It's not our Knowledge that draws another
But it's energy field
It's not Divyaa who reaches out 
But Consciousness
It's not you that I touch
But That I Am 

Love from my heart to yours

,Ellaeenah,"I am a spiritual health facilitator, mindfulness teacher, and 'transform life' coach/spiritual counsellor. I am an energy intuitive whose deep understanding of Ancient Wisdom has been translated into invaluable practical insights that have empowered and enriched the innumerable people I have worked with. My work extends into the realms of the Spirit-Psyche, such that life is directed by consciousness of thought, word and feeling, and results in self-empowerment.
 
My aim is to help free all persons---children, teenagers, young adults or mature caretakers--- from the harsh patterns of unconscious living, which cause conflict and strain in relationships and human interaction. My energy therapy and spiritual counselling sessions consist of body therapy using crystals, music, sound, flowers and so on, as well as talk therapy. I work extensively with teenagers as well, to help them get through what can be harsh teenage years, so that the communication gap between them and their parents/family is considerably reduced. The focus of all her work is facilitation of self-empowerment in all. Relationship and family counselling is a significant part of what I do.
 
I has been working in this field for several years, and my work includes extensive personal one on one work, and seminars and workshops that are very popular and enlightening. I have been been interviewed by leading newspapers, and have written for them as well. I been invited on more than one occasion by the Rotary Clubs to speak on the changes required in the field of education, and have been a guest speaker at Bombay Management Association Convention for Women as well as INDUS, and present annual modules at the Daver's College.
 
My intuitive study of the soul and the resultant insights into Esoteric Healing, Esoteric Psychology and Esoteric Astrology has contributed significantly in the awakening of the spirits of people who are caught in the mire of everyday conflict. Spirit-taught and Spirit-trained, my intuition and insights are gathered from my own direct experience which has transmuted knowledge to a rich body of wisdom that is ever deepening and constantly widening.
 
I focus significantly on one-on-one 'transformed life' coaching for CEO's and higher Management.
 
I conduct several seminars and workshops on a range of subjects, with the focus of each on self-healing , Bach Flower Therapy, and self-empowerment. My mission is to help as many as I can to peel away the veils that mask the inner truth, so that no experience is distorted, but is valid and significant in the truth that it presents to you. 

I have written a channeled E-Book entitled ‘And Jade Fire Said’, and have co-authored a ready reckoner for Bach Flower Remedies entitled 'Bach To A Healthy Life'. My channeled cards, and Bach Flower Therapy Cards are in the process of being readied for printing and distribution.
