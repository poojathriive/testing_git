		<description><![CDATA[Polarity Therapy is a holistic practice which was created in the late 19th century by Dr. Randolph Stone. A mixture of both Eastern and Western energy therapies, Polarity Therapy believes that an electromagnetic energy field surrounds the body and moves between its poles (positive, negative and neutral). The energy centers are based on the Ayurvedic chakras and the Traditional Chinese Medicine principle of yin and yang. Any blockage to the smooth and balanced flow of this energy causes dis-ease in the body. The Human Energy Field is affected by diet, touch, exercise, relationships and life experience. Polarity Therapy works on the principle of balancing these effects through bodywork, touch, exercises, counseling and nutritional advice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Resonant Field Imaging (RFI) evaluates the aura or biofield of a body using electromagnetic feedback. RFI involves the use of small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip is capable of carrying around 2000 bytes of data. The RFID device serves the same purpose as a bar code or a magnetic strip on the back of an ATM card – it provides a unique identifier for that object. And, just as a barcode or magnetic strip must be scanned to get the information, the RFID device scans the body to retrieve identifying information such as Aura and Chakra Analysis, Brainwave Analysis, Organ level analysis, Vaastu (Objects and Spaces) Analysis and Botanical Analysis (Plants and Trees). It also finds much use in studying the behaviour of animals and in paranormal investigations.]]></description>
