1646,"Zia Nath","Danseuse - Realms of Dance™
In 1994, at the Osho International Meditation Resort, Pune, India, Zia witnessed the performance of Gurdjieff Sacred Dances. Watching this was a profound experience, it invoked the witness within her. She was stunned by the grace of the simple yet perfectly coordinated linear movements with complex foot work and soul stirring music. Watching the meditative silence on the dancer’s faces and the stillness of their center left an indelible impression, one that changed the course of Zia’s career. Zia studied Gurdjieff Sacred Dances at the Osho Commune in Puna in 1995 and thereafter travelled to America and Europe over several years to study the sufi work and the sacred dances under world renowned teachers of the Gurdjieff – Bennett tradition. With the influence of sufi musicians and the understanding of Sufi music and Osho’s guidance, Zia self trained as a Whirler. In recent years Zia has been passionately involved in the study of Odissi Indian Classical dances under the tutelage of Smt Jhelum Paranjpe and Sri Sanatan Chakravarty of Smitalaya. The ceremonial and devotional aspect of this work is similar to that of the Sufi Sacred Dances and this inspired Zia to weave the three diverse dances forms into one show, with sufi music and poetry as the common thread that connects them all.

In 2007 Zia originated her show Sufi Splendour®, and now re-launched as Realms of Dance™ in September 2016. Realms of Dance is a spectacular presentation of Sacred Dance &amp; Whirling Mandala™, rendered to music and poetry of renowned artists and mystics. Zia has performed at prestigious festivals and events across the country and internationally, sharing the mystique of our sacred heritage.
Conceptualized and created by Zia Nath, Realms Of Dance™ is inspired from ancient sculpted stories of the Temples of Orissa, and the wild abandon of spinning gypsies of India and Asia. These dances are tales of love suspended in the realms of sensuality and spirituality. Expressed as movement translations of ancient sutras and passionate poetry, laced with lyrical music of Indian and Persian origin, the dances create a tapestry of rhythm, mystique and magic.
Dances are presented as solo, duet or with a troupe, in collaboration with renowned dance exponents and dance schools.

Professionally Zia is a natural healthcare practitioner and India’s first internationally certified Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapist. Zia has been in this practice since the past 15 years and her clinic is now the organizer of International Foundation Trainings of Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy, Diploma courses in Mumbai.",https://thriive.noesis.tech/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zia_nath.jpg,zia_nath.jpg,"Alternative Therapies>Accupressure|Alternative Therapies>Colour Therapy",,,,,0,0,"Carnio Sacral Therapy, Sufi Whriling","15,20",,,realmsofdance@gmail.com,9821470396,5/9/1973,,,,,,,

1648,"Nidhi Pandya","For as long as I can remember, I have been preoccupied with the idea of how to live a better, fuller and happier life. Being the grand-daughter of an Ayurvedic healer and a spiritual master, my relationship with holistic living started at birth. Our big joint family comprised of 14 members, all of whom had the same lifestyle and food but were very different people. I thus acquired a natural curiosity and understanding of how the human mind works as well as how associations early on in life go a long way in determining the overall attitude of an individual.

In 2002, I founded a value development school called Vyaktitiva to counsel young adolescents and help them find purpose in whatever they do.

In 2004, I moved to the United States and ended up working with a pharmaceutical company for a year. I came face to face with the glaring flaws of the current medical system and its misalignment with the principles of nature. My roots became dearer to me than ever before.

I am getting a formal education in Ayurveda from Shubham Ayurveda, studying the Sanskrit ancient texts of Carak Samhita and Ashtanga Hrudayam. I have also studied Naturopathy with Dr Vjaya Venkat and Holistic nutrition at the Global College of Natural Medicine.

Wellness to me means aligning your body and mind to only consume what nourishes you on both levels. This can only happen when you truly understand your body and are able to tune in to your mind.

Wellness is not the fear of sickness, it is the freedom that comes with being well. Join me in my journey and lets move towards a happier, better and fuller life.",https://thriive.noesis.tech/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nidhi_pandya.jpg,nidhi_pandya.jpg,"Natural Remedies>Ayurveda|Yoga>Hatha Yoga|Meditation>Meditation",,,,,0,0,"Ayurveda, Hatha yoga, Meditation","7,15,15,",,,nidhini@gmail.com,9176716875,08/10/1981,,,,,,,

2036,"Divyaa Kummar","I am often introduced as  a contemporary spiritual facilitator,  writer and energy worker  reaching out in various ways – but these are simply terms to be used -  as I see myself more as a fellow traveler on the path with those on the journey to Self. A deep spiritual font that spontaneously opened up within me in 2001/2 is the very core from where all the work that happens through a ‘me’ continues to stem. My reaching out also ‘happened’ spontaneously, and I truly feel it is Grace that allows ‘me’ to  receive this intuitive understanding, but even more Grace that i can enable fellow travelers on the path too.  

This spiritual foundation is currently expressed through several modalities: Tarot readings and Tarot workshops; Dr Bach remedies healing and Dr Bach remedies workshops; Theta meditative healing sessions and of course Spiritual discourses, Spiritual counseling, and Meditation groups – and these days - face book satsangs!
 
Tarot is taught from the larger macroscopic point of view, where divination is not viewed in only terms of predictions but optimally in ‘Knowing Thyself. The workshop opens up an enchanting world of symbols for each one to endlessly explore, and in that to harness their positive energies! This in-depth exploration of Tarot allows it to be used in a gamut of ways:  as a spiritual journey/guidance, a counseling tool to 'know thyself' or the more layman practical guidance that we need time to time.

Dr Bach Remedy workshops also share both the practical and deeper aspects.  I truly believe that just like authentic spiritual teachers help you to reach your own inner guru - Dr Bach’s remedies allow you to be your and your family’s own best healer – emotionally, spiritually or even physically.    It is one of the simplest and practical systems to learn and use - a handy tool kit during phases of minor or major upsets that every family goes through or as an energy tweak towards ones spiritual ripening.

Personal sessions (Tarot, Bach and Theta meditative healing) are on prior appointment. 


It's not our words that impact another 
But their truth 
It's not our Knowledge that draws another
But it's energy field
It's not Divyaa who reaches out 
But Consciousness
It's not you that I touch
But That I Am

2037,Ellaeenah,"I am a spiritual health facilitator, mindfulness teacher, and 'transform life' coach/spiritual counsellor. I am an energy intuitive whose deep understanding of Ancient Wisdom has been translated into invaluable practical insights that have empowered and enriched the innumerable people I have worked with. My work extends into the realms of the Spirit-Psyche, such that life is directed by consciousness of thought, word and feeling, and results in self-empowerment.
 
My aim is to help free all persons---children, teenagers, young adults or mature caretakers--- from the harsh patterns of unconscious living, which cause conflict and strain in relationships and human interaction. My energy therapy and spiritual counselling sessions consist of body therapy using crystals, music, sound, flowers and so on, as well as talk therapy. I work extensively with teenagers as well, to help them get through what can be harsh teenage years, so that the communication gap between them and their parents/family is considerably reduced. The focus of all her work is facilitation of self-empowerment in all. Relationship and family counselling is a significant part of what I do.
 
I has been working in this field for several years, and my work includes extensive personal one on one work, and seminars and workshops that are very popular and enlightening. I have been been interviewed by leading newspapers, and have written for them as well. I been invited on more than one occasion by the Rotary Clubs to speak on the changes required in the field of education, and have been a guest speaker at Bombay Management Association Convention for Women as well as INDUS, and present annual modules at the Daver's College.
 
My intuitive study of the soul and the resultant insights into Esoteric Healing, Esoteric Psychology and Esoteric Astrology has contributed significantly in the awakening of the spirits of people who are caught in the mire of everyday conflict. Spirit-taught and Spirit-trained, my intuition and insights are gathered from my own direct experience which has transmuted knowledge to a rich body of wisdom that is ever deepening and constantly widening.
 
I focus significantly on one-on-one 'transformed life' coaching for CEO's and higher Management.
 
I conduct several seminars and workshops on a range of subjects, with the focus of each on self-healing , Bach Flower Therapy, and self-empowerment. My mission is to help as many as I can to peel away the veils that mask the inner truth, so that no experience is distorted, but is valid and significant in the truth that it presents to you. 

I have written a channeled E-Book entitled ‘And Jade Fire Said’, and have co-authored a ready reckoner for Bach Flower Remedies entitled 'Bach To A Healthy Life'. My channeled cards, and Bach Flower Therapy Cards are in the process of being readied for printing and distribution.

2039,"Haritha Nayak","HARITHA NAYAK grew up in a town in the Himalayas in India. Born in a family with spiritual bent of mind, from her childhood she used to question about the purpose of her life. With advocate parents, when she was little, she was very light in weight and hence her father used to balance the cradle by keeping his law books on one side. She used to spend most of her time with her grandfather who used to tell her stories of ancient Sages, Vedas & Yogis and help her chant Mantras. She used to sit in silence & focus on her third eye chakra, believing that to be communication point to connect to God and meditate. She used to see people around her praying to god and always asking for fulfilment of wishes which she never felt ok with. So one day she asked her grandmother, a very spiritual person, that what should one ask God for and she replied “We have been provided with everything that we need to learn to become a better person, so we should only ask God to give us strength & patience if we have to go through the difficult times for some learning”. This statement made a huge impact on her mind. While growing up, Buddha used to attract her attention. One day in her class, she was introduced to the teachings of Buddha and on hearing the Mantra “Buddham Sharanam Gacchami...”, it acted as a trigger and she cried with tears of Joy.

Teaching came naturally to her. While only 8 years old, she used to teach the kids in her community on all the subjects. Herself an excellent student with interest in computer science, she did her Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications. While doing first year of her graduation, she was already teaching computer languages and programming in an institute in her hometown to students who were doing their Master degree in computers and engineering. She then completed Master’s Degree in Business Administration from one of the most prestigious Women’s University in India, Banasthali Vidhyapith. She moved to Bangalore in year 2007 for her job at Bennett, Coleman & Company in their Internet division. As the universe had planned the synchronicity, the first day of joining itself, she met Santhosh, her soul mate and now her husband and she knew that she will be living this life with him and they will be learning together. After seven years of career with various organizations in India like Times of India, Oracle and Lenovo she started getting her signs to move to the next step of learning. From her childhood, she used to get powerful dreams, she knew they were messages, however at that time she could not understand them. Her soul was continuously seeking for the right guidance to come in her life.

Finally in year 2012, after experiencing a fulfilling corporate career, Haritha decided to explore the true purpose of her life and went to Rishikesh in an Ashram on the banks of river Ganga. She stayed there for some time but her soul was asking for more and absolute truth. In this quest, she attended a Buddhist silence retreat and for the first time she felt peace inside her. Still sensing that there is a missing link, she learnt Past Life Regression and qualified as a therapist in 2013. She was still, asking the universe every day to bring her the true knowledge meant for ascension of her soul. And finally her prayers were answered in October 2013 when she met Kaya and Christiane in Pyramid Valley, Bangalore. Looking at them, she felt that she has known them before; it was not the first time. The purity and profoundness of energy in Kaya and Christiane made her feel as if she had found what she was seeking since many lives. While talking, Christiane suggested her to invoke Angel Damabiah to understand the true meaning of a nightmare that she used to receive since childhood. That was her first experience with this work and even though she chanted Angel Damabiah for 5 minutes only before sleeping, the nightmare dream completed for the first time and never appeared again! Before attending the workshop next day, she had already read everything on UCM Website and knew her birth angels. The workshop created more curiosity in her, however, she knew with joy, that this is the path that will answer all her questions and take her to a profound inner journey.  This was the beginning of new evolution for her. Christiane, very kindly offered Haritha, her help to move forward on the path of working with 72 Angels and Dreams.  She started working with the Angelic calendar to invoke the Angels and started noting down her dreams. Christiane continued to help her understand her inner programs that needed to be worked on in order to become a better soul.  The self-work with Angels that takes one into deep seated memories in the subconscious and helps to cleanse is the most profound work that she found. She is learning and experiencing her inner world more each day and is on the path of inner transformations in DSSI (Dreams-Signs-Symbols Interpretation) under the guidance of UCM Professors.

Haritha, now under the guidance of Kaya, Christiane Muller & Dr Francois Bouchard shares the knowledge of Angelica Yana in India. She is supported and inspired by her husband Santhosh in this Angelic Mission, who is also continuing with the DSSI program. Over the years, she was guided in her dreams, to bring this ancient technique of breathing with Angels in the modern times. Angelica Yana technique involves invoking an Angel along with conscious connected breathing to lift the veil to unconscious, that enables the seeker to go into the memories which are yet to transform. The Angelic wisdom and symbolic understanding of these memories, that emerge in form of sensations, pains or visions during a Yana Session, help the seeker to profoundly experience and understand the distortions in them and transform them with continued chanting of the Angelica Mantra during the session. Haritha, along with Santhosh, is now devoted to UCM, to be able to bring this Knowledge to people who have been waiting for the true Knowledge, to decode and connect to source code of their soul and one day Become an Angel!",,,,,,,,0,0,"Rebirthing, Past Life Regression, Dream Analysis , Angelic Chanting","4,4,4,4",,,haritha.nayak@ucm.in,9902931498,30/04/1980,,,,haritha.nayak@ucm.in,,,

She has also done her Early Child Care course from ORT India, Worli and taught at the Headstart Pre School, Prathna Samaj. Apart from interior designing her passion for fine arts and spirituality has inspired her to spread the awareness of the powers of this ancient & scared tool of Mandala Colouring.

Mandalas have existed since the beginning of time and you witness and experience their beauty every day.

Simply stated, a mandala is a sacred circle. The word mandala comes from the ancient Sanskrit language and loosely means “circle” or “center.” It’s a simple geometric shape that has no beginning or end. The fact is that, the circular structure is the main foundation of our universe. Look at our solar system, look at the cells of your body, look at a flower….it’s everywhere! Your eyes are a beautiful mandala example, with your iris as the center. The sun in the sky, the nucleus of the cells in your body, and the pristine design of a snowflake all reflect the sacred roundness of the mandala. In truth, the mandala is all of these representations and even more. One of the easiest and most effective ways to experience the power of the mandala is by colouring. 
 
Within its circular shape, the mandala has the power to promote relaxation, develop mindfulness and concentration, enhance your creativity, and strengthen the focus and focus skills. The great news is you can achieve all of these benefits while having fun with mandala coloring.",,,"Art Therapy>Mandala",,,,,0,0,Mandala,1,,,shilpa.911@hotmail.com,9821457874,11/9/2017,https://www.facebook.com/shilpa.desai,,,shilpa.911@hotmail.com,,,

Her association with the Dr. M.L. Dhawale Trust and Institute of Clinical Research has provided her with numerous opportunities to involve in group processes, seminars and teaching activities in homoeopathy. These have contributed to her interpersonal and communication skills, and analytical capacity.

A desire to learn more led her to study psychology, through various courses. This knowledge enriched by a deep understanding of the flow of life helps others find their path in couseling sessions.

A natural quest for spiritual evolution and natural philosophical leanings brought her to explore regression therapy under Dr. Newton Kondavetti. 

Her first experience of Past Life as a young Swedish girl gave her an insight into the purpose of her life. She dedicates herself to being a medium to light the path of awareness and conscious living for seekers. 

As a Past Life Regression Therapist and Inner Child Work facilitator she has  conducted many personal sessions, presented novel ideas and inputs for research during workshops in annual conventions by the Association for Regression and Reincarnation Research (ARRR).

They are authorised as trainers by  Quantum Life University  to facilitate workshops in Past Life Regression and Spiritual Sciences and  Inner Child Healing.

They also offer their workshop - Being the Eternal Observer across several cities in India. Stories of transformation in participants of this 2 day workshop bring awe and leave one wondering.

Her special interests lie in Infant oral and sucking dysfunction, tongue tie treatment & rehabilitation including babies, children and adults. Under her private practice, nourish & nurture is an outreach clinic for families seeking professional clinical lactation management, parenting counseling and craniosacral biodynamic treatment.

Yasmin serves on several national & international boards, committees and share their path & vision:
of advocacy, awareness and service for safe & supported pregnancy, labor, birth & breastfeeding; (BIRTH INDIA, IBLCE)
of spreading knowledge & education via global lactation online conferences; (GOLD LACTATION)
of providing collaborative professional networking platform for clinicians who work in the field of tongue & lip tie. (International Consortium of Ankylofrenula professional - ICAP)

Yasmin also spearheaded the much needed professional support group for clinical discussion on tongue ties. The professional group now has close to 1500 clinicians including IBCLCs', surgeons, dentists, pediatricians, ENT Specialists, and body workers such as craniosacral therapists and myofunctional oral therapists who work with families who are affected with tongue & lip tie midline congenital anamaly. 

She writes extensively on lactation, tongue tie, parenting & biodynamic craniosacral therapy in several Indian print and online magazines. She is also serves on the panel of experts for 'Mother & Baby'. 'Mother's World', Baby Chakra among others. Her exceptional clinical acumen & skills and her deeply compassionate care makes her support 'invaluable' as marked by her clients. However she firmly believes the term 'expert' denotes how the contemporary world has moved away from traditional wisdom of instinctual perception to 'expert' view. The central role she therefore plays is to restore the wisdom of 'instinctual perception' to individuals & parents.

Her clinical research work has been published in the International Journal of Laser Dentistry (IJLD) about tongue tie and its treatment outcome and contributed chapters in medical textbook on the same subject in the ""Fundamentals of Laser Dentistry.""

What is Pranic healing
Pranic energy Therapy is a science of transferring Life Force or Prana to create well being. Everything is energy including our words, emotions, thoughts and actions. Pranic Energy Therapy uses simple but powerful techniques to remove and dissolve negative and contaminated energy and replace it with positive, vital, healing expansive energy.

Not just for the Body mind and spirit…..
These techniques can also be used to correct imbalances in vortices of energy that control all human activities such as relationships, finances and work and home environments.
Whether your challenges have been long term or recent life events have triggered “old stuff,”  Pranic Healing can give you the confidence and the resources you need to move 
forward.

I have been feeling this love of life for me as long as I can remember, yet like a stuboorn child have been resisting the surrender. As a caring mom, she has been bringing me to the same square through various roads and yet somehow I have been unwilling to let my open eyes see what has always been there.
That was until I realised that all that is needed is a surrender. And when that happened, the mother's womb opened gently revraling all that fulfils the purpose of existence.
For me, I have at this moment realised that working with the most fundamental energy is the purpose I am here to serve; the energy called money.
The three basic needs of food, shelter and clothing today translate into this one basic medium: Money! From the point I stand, I have seen money at the base of life itself, not only as a commodity, but also as the most powerful and swift medium of exchange of life-energy itself.",,,"Art Therapy>Sacred Geometry",,,,,0,0,"Sacred Geometry, Emotional Freedom Technique, Osho Dynamic meditation","20,12,12",,,abundantpransen@gmail.com,8888103989,29/11/1978,,,,abundantpransen@gmail.com,,,

2097,"Kasshmira D  Changkakty","Having a successful business  and operating my own travel agency since last 28yrs  and also having a successful Insurance agency and being a good  investment consultant I knew there was more to life than having or doing all of this.  All this had no joy for me. I was doing it right but I was not happy.

I have always been  a seeker,  someone who always has known there has to be more possibilities  than what I can see in this world.  I always wondered what could I do to change my life and make it more meaningful for myself and everyone around me.

I remember very clearly that I could do or achieve anything I would set my mind on.  The word impossible was never in my dictionary and for which people often rebuked me and told me to shut up. This made me even more confident to prove I could do it. In the past I have done or created things which could either be called magical or as I now know it as just Being me. I never actually paid attention on what i use to create. 

I had tried many modalities like Reki, auto writing but never felt totally committed to it. During those years I was told that I should not indulge into such things as it's not for people like us. Since then my limitations were set for me until I was shaken up by some event in my life.

In 2012 I lost something very valuable which could never be replaced.  This was my final awakening call when I started looking at my life and what i had acheived  whether it had any meaning.  So after evaluating I started moving towards doing something  which always gave me joy  and opened up a lot of possibilities for my creativity. So I restarted my journey by doing modalities like  Shaminism,  Past Life Regression, Innerchild, Breath Work, Realm Reading, Angel oracle card reading, Crystal Healing, Switchword,, Sound of Shiva and Nada Yoga (Sound Therapy).

My search carried on and my quest for more knowlege in this field increased. I was always attracted to such things and felt that there would be something more when I came across the world of Access Consciousness thru face lift.

Here I knew that Access held a special place in my heart as it resonated with me and what I felt. It made me feel so good about myself.  The Best thing it gave me choice to choose what i wanted not what was right about it or true about it. It made me question my life at every point and startwd helping me create me.

This journey which I restarted again from 2012 gave me the conviction to share this with everyone and make this world an awesome place with a little of my contribution. I went on to complete my certification for teaching The Bars the first entry to Access Conciousness and here I am",,,,,,,,0,0,"Access Bars, Angel Reading, Crystal Healing","2,2,3",,,kasshmira@yahoo.com,9322657306,17/08/1960,,,,kasshmira@yahoo.com,,,

2103,"Smita M. Wankhade","Smita Wankhade, founder/architect of “Trinetra Centre for Healing & Enlightenment” is an expert in the field of mind-body synergy and is a strong advocate in the healing power of Spirituality. A powerful and compelling life coach, she has a talent for inspiring her clients to live their lives on purpose and make positive changes; inviting them to explore new possibilities, discover their passions, achieve their potential and realize their dreams.
An MA in Arts, it was very early in life that she started pursuing yoga and meditation with a passion. She found herself being drawn to Mysticism and its enchantments after her unusual experiences like ‘seeing’ a soul, ‘being out-of-the-body’. She found her calling as a Spiritual Guide and this interest took a formal turn with her getting certified as Breath Worker, Past Life Regressionist, Inner-Child Healer, Reiki Master, Peak Performance Coach from Quantum Life University , Hyderabad. She continued to add to her repertoire of skills and is also a certified coach in Enneagram and Family Constellation. She has already conducted lectures, meditation workshops and healing sessions at various places, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune and Nashik. Her present aim is to ensure that the benefit of her knowledge and experience reaches as many people as possible.  
The goal of her services is to rebalance your mind and body through life’s many transitions and challenges. At Trinetra Centre for Healing & Enlightenment, she helps you reach a place where the physical and emotional stress in your life is reduced, thereby allowing positive changes to occur. She advocates a holistic approach to helping individuals on their journey to wellness by letting go of those things you feel are holding you back and understanding every life obstacle is only temporary.  With the aid of her workshops, healing sessions and personal interaction, she promotes a beautiful progression toward a healthier life. The  purpose is to create optimal health and balance for all who wish to take part in their own healing journey.
This natural flair of Smita’s to empathize and relate with people and heal them has come with her years of interaction with a wide diversity of people, ranging from teenagers to middle-aged adults. From her early years she has been working with children- guiding them, molding them gently but firmly with love and understanding, inspiring them through academics, art, craft and handicraft, abacus, games, dance, meditation, and workshops. For over six years she was the core group member of a social organization “SujanPalak” which focused on the art of responsible and sensible parenting. SujanPalak is the project of the NGO “Abhivyakti”. She works closely with people to create a dynamic relationship that supports a powerful journey and outcome. In her spare time, Smita loves to spend time with her family, has a green thumb and loves growing organic produce in her home garden and finds her peace in painting and reading.",,,,,,,,0,0,"Past Life Regression, Rebirthing,Ennegram of Personality, Ana Pana Sati Meditation","12,10,8,14",,,smwankhade3@gmail.com,0253-2354150/9689899767,12/12/1964,facebook.com/jeans333,,,smwankhade3@gmail.com,,,

2111,"Cicily  Thomas","Cicily was born in Madras (now Chennai), the youngest of nine siblings.  Her earliest memories of her childhood, are of her fondness for nature, and an intense desire to be outdoors, one with nature.  The wee hours of the morning were her favourite time of the day and even as a ten year old, she would venture out to  jog and breathe in fresh air at 4AM.
An energetic and a bubbly girl, she always looked for ways and means to expend her energy in out door activities. When she entered Class VIII, she discovered tennis, and took to it like fish to water. Now all her energies, and every paisa she had were devoted to learning and excelling in that sport.Even a great setback when her father passed away suddenly  around this time,  leaving a huge vacuum, only increased her rigour and training in Tennis and she even took a part time job to pay for her training. Her commitment  and dedication earned her a scholarship for Tennis from the Sports Authority of India, and she went on to represent her University and the state of Tamilnadu, and won gold.
If love for nature was the key child hood theme, and exercise and sport her teenage anchors, growing up years were all about wanting to be healer. Florence Nightingale was her role model. She joined Stella Maris College in Madras to do her fine arts and languages, and then went on to study for a masters in Pyschology.
There still was a lot of restlessness in her.  Mountaineering, skiing, adventure sports, all gave her an opportunity to be with nature, but the energy was still restless energy. Then, in 1991, destiny brought her in touch with Tai Chi. On her skiing trip to Pyrenees in France, she saw a man, bare bodied, in the chilling cold, practicing the martial art, which she later learnt was the ancient marial art form of Tai Chi.  The image was etched forever in her mind , the inner calm on his face leaving her in awe.
It took five more years for Cicily to actually get to learm Tai Chi. She was introduced to it by her elder brother, who trained under Grand Master Fu Sheng Yuan.  The gentle, fluid movements of Tai Chi, helped her expereince an “inner calm and balance”. The restless energy she carried, seemed to be channelised, and brought her in touch with her inner self. It had a cathartic effect on her and finally the trauma of the death of her father , which she carried in her all these years was addressed, a new resilience deveoped and she felt like a new person. The healing and therapeutic power of Tai Chi, became apparent to her.
It was in one such moments of inner calm and balance, she realised that this was her true calling. She made it her mission to master Tai Chi and bring it to larger public so that they too can expereince the healing and theraupeutic power of Tai Chi.
Thus began the journey and Cicily went to China and refined her skills under Grand Master Fu Sheng Yuan and under his son Fu Qing. She later learnt Qigong, a therapeutic form of the exercise from the famed Dr.Yang Jwing Ming.  
She is a certified master, the only female in India and refuses  to adopt the title“Sifu” because of its highly masculine connotations.
In 2008, Cicily decided to convert her passion for Tai Chi, into a full-time profession. She started ‘Force Vitale’ (now rechristened to ‘Vital Force Tai Chi Academy’),  and has devoted her life to the spreading of this form, and bring health and vitality through movement .  A lot of her classes are in the open, in the lap of nature thus bringing together all the themes of being with nature, movement and healing.",,,"Body Work>Tai Chi",,,,,0,0,"Tai Chi, Carnio Sacral Therapy","20, 3",,,vitalforcetaichi@gmail.com,9449633267,21/07/1968,,,,vitalforcetaichi@gmail.com,,,

Numerology tells of our potential life's purpose, our natural talents and helps us gain a better understanding of ourselves and others.  It shows us the pathway we need to take in our lives to fulfil this potential, and also, tells us one of the many reasons why each one has different traits and characteristics.

The initial years of mine in the computer business were full of obstacles and big learnings. With this arose a quest to understand the root cause and I thus reached Oneness University.
It was here that I discovered my life purpose and expertise. I have conducted many programs for the Oneness University from as little as ten people to a massive crowd of over a thousand. Spiritual learning arose out of passion and I started trainings in my free time. Today I am a Breakthrough Life Coach, Certified Corporate Trainer from American Tesol Institute and Peak Performance trainings. I am also trained in Nlp, Silva, Reiki, Dream Interpretation, Bachflower remedies, Matrushakti healings apart from being a Yoga Master. I have undergone deep internal processes, and am a Healer and undertake Healing contracts of individuals and businesses (small scale & corporate). My most exclusive and specialized healing is Ancestral healing where I heal doshas and patterns coming from ancestors.

“I aim at change and Breakthrough. I work primarily on the cause and effect theory. I see so many people just beating around the bushes trying to heal the effects and devote time, energy and money for the same without any notable results. I used to do the same for so many years, by the time I realized it, so many years were lost. My role is to help people reach their causes as the solution lies only in that domain, but the human psychology is to run after effects as those are the ones which are visible. So many of us are trying to change the outside, but it's only when we change the inside the external changes. Change is not easy and never happens overnight, it’s a process and so is life. I undertake coaching assignments to help people make this transition from struggle to achievement, despair to hope and most important from a learner to achieve. Its just one life we live lets live it with success.” - Veejay Israani",,,"Art Therapy>Sacred Geometry",,,,,0,0,"Kundalini Activation, Bach Flower remedies, Channelling, Sacred Geometry","2,2,3,1",,,veejayisraani@gmail.com,9820852660,21/10/1971,,,,veejayisraani@gmail.com,,,

It took me just a few minutes into my first hypnotherapy class to know, “this is the first step”. Even before I became a Clinical Hypnotherapist, I had found my love for metaphysics through Reiki, Tarot Card Readings, Crystal healing, Runes etc. After that, there was no looking back and finally giving up my full time job, I have now dedicated myself to Consultation, Training and Healing through various holistic methods.",,,Hypnotherapy,,,,,0,0,"Angel Reading , Tarot card Reading, Hypnotherapy, crystal healing","7, 9,9,9",,,seemamohnot@hotmail.com,9810018011,26/11/1966,https://www.facebook.com/healwithswapna/,,https://twitter.com/healwithswapna,seemamohnot@hotmail.com,,,

In this physical body, I came into existence on 10th August’ 1974 but as a soul, I don’t remember how many lifetimes I have experienced to reach here. I started my career as a teacher and worked for almost 5 years but I wanted to do something else. Not knowing what that something else was, I did my computer course from NIIT and then from big leap, opened up own venture of website designing and development with a friend. Despite putting years of hard work into it, I was not satisfied. I used to be restless as if I was craving to be connected with something deeper, something that could satisfy the quest of my soul and then destiny revealed it’s plans & I landed up learning Reiki.

The moment I entered into healing world, everything seemed to happen magically & effortlessly. It was as if mystic world was calling out for me since long. And today, I am a healer by profession and I practice and teach -

I was fascinated by the real life cases he spoke about and realized this was something I would love to learn.  At that time I was getting married and moving to Africa. My fascination for hypnotherapy continued over the years and I read other books on the subject. In 2004 I moved back to India. As luck would have it a workshop on hypnotherapy was being taught in my city by Dr Sunny Satin of California hypnosis Institute. This was the perfect opportunity to know more about the subject and the process. I joined the workshop, but nothing had prepared me for what happened thereafter. The workshop opened the flood gates of everything that was pent up in me over so many years. The process of hypnotherapy took me deeper into my subconscious space and i discovered feelings and emotions which I had no clue existed. I realized how fragile I was and how much needed to be healed. Childhood memories which I had forgotten, incidents that happened and the impact of that on my mental and emotional state. I was rediscovering myself - and so began the process of my healing.
As my interest in complementary medecine grew i learnt other modalities like NLP, Family Constellation Therapy, Heal Ypur Life based techniques, Art Based Therapy, Integral Somatic Psychology and Tasso
I am also a teacher for many of these therapies that I practice. Ialso work with an NGO Asha Sadan, where I use Art Based Therapy to work with Chikdren at Risk

I've been on a beautiful journey of self-discovery. On the way I've met many teachers who have held my hand and guided me.

Bio     About a decade ago, I treaded on a new path that resonated with my sensibilities and persona. I had always possessed high sensitivity and emotional quotient which sharpened through ups and downs and organic growth in life. I believe that I can lend a healing hand and smoothen the rough edges in the lives of others through my healing, psychic and people's person skills of relating and connecting on deeper levels. An instinctive soul, I began to follow and hear my intuition very closely in the last decade. This inner churning was complemented by experiences which were premonitory, vivid with explicit visions, dreams and incidences before major happenings in and around my life. 23 years of work experience out of which 16 years of mentoring and teaching English Literature and language to hundreds of students and another 8 years of social development work cemented my belief that I could heal, relate to and help all age groups in different genres of life through my warm, empathetic and clairvoyant approach to stress and strains of life. That’s when I set out on a mission to bring happiness, focus and passion in the lives of those who are distressed and needed guidance through various healing/psychic mediums and energies that I am gifted to work with. My innate intuitive spirit led me to comfort and relieve many a sad and dejected souls of their negativity and lean times through various form of energy healing and on to the road of contentment, normalcy and happiness. I am a certified healer in the following realms of Energy Healing: Angel card reading Angel Therapy Reiki Healing Crystal Healing Chakra healing Along with certification, I have had hands on learning in the various realms of energy work along with my intuitive and Claire gifts. I provide a professional and personalized holistic healing and psychic counselling and soul therapy for all age groups and for every facet of life be it professional, financial, personal relationship, goals, health and holistic life to enable the innate potential in all to empower and lead a happy, healthy and content life.

2207,Kavita,"I am Kavita Agarwal Saraf, 38 years of age.
I have done my B.com, Diploma in Commercial arts and Multimedia design from Ahmedabad, Gujarat and Post graduation diploma in Psychotherapy and counselling from Nagpur, Maharastra.
I had started an exhibition gallery by the name of Gondwana gallery inNagpur, 13 years back, which is running successfully since then. 

However, the quest in this healing field began 5 years back in 2013, which started with my own healing and exploring this vast field.
To explore my passion, various modalities of healing I started enrolling for various certified workshops and learnt a lot. I then completely shifted, as the prior work was already set and did not have scope of personal growth.
 Human psychology, philosophy and energy healing are my favorite subjects. 
Therefore, to formalize it and learn about it in detail I did my diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy from IPMS, Nagpur.

Now I am currently practicing and taking counselling sessions, workshops, soft skill training launched under the name of “MERAKI-A soulful endeavor”. I am also practicing Arts based therapy.

Starting period, venture profile

I started practicing in July 2015
I take personalize counselling sessions for Psychological awareness, Spiritual awareness, and Relationship awareness and life style awareness.
I also conduct workshops of self-designed programmers like “Healing with Angels” and “Pre teen power “which was received well.

Motivation behind it

It all started with healing myself physically, emotionally, mentally which lead to spiritual growth and learning thru various experience, which helped me understand the true essence of life.
Therefore, I gave into my calling! I wanted to share the wisdom that I keep learning and developed various skills and abilities too. The urge to empower others and feeling the responsibility of the next generation motivated me to go ahead.
However the basic lapse in the education system moved me big time after even qualifying very well in my formal education still I lacked the art of living life, managing health issues, tackling various relationship, even being confused  about the  right way to connect to the Divine,  and this lost feeling made me seek things and explore.

Future Plans..

My plans are to go ahead with my soft skill training's, counselling sessions, design meaningful workshops, conduct Arts based workshops, and live my life to the fullest too.
I even work with Corporate, schools and colleges and would further like to work in association with various groups  and organisations on the similar lines,
I would have my own office and training center soon.. mean while I am free lancing, working and exploring. Besides that, learning at my end will always continue, which helps me grow personally and develop my own creative ways of putting it across and contribute to developing others too.",,,,,,,,0,0,"Life Coaching",3,,,kavitaagarwalsaraf@gmail.com,9766338986,29/01/1980,,,,kavitaagarwalsaraf@gmail.com,,,

This prompted her to delve deeper into other healing modalities and keep moving forward in her spiritual path even at a very tender age. Her quest eventually led her to dedicate her life to provide spiritual mentoring and healing to everyone looking for spiritual and alternative methods of healing and therapies.

Chandana has helped hundreds of her clients in relieving them of their pains and diseases be it physical, emotional or mental. She has been instrumental in having a profound impact on her clients by helping them in opening up to new spiritual insights and wisdom. Her clients experience major shift in perception, connecting them with their authentic nature and helping them lead a truely meaningful and purposeful life.

She spiritual quest has taken her to other countries like US where she had the good fortune of meeting and learning from the stalwarts of the spiritual field like Late Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dr. Brian Weiss, Doreen Virtue, Greg Braden, Shakti Gawain and many more spiritual luminaries.

Udumbara is an advanced beings culture in our multiverse. They are the guardians of the Navel portal wisdom. Navel Consciousness is this healing & living wisdom. 

Your navel is not just a scar. It has a role, an impact & a function. And without this information we are shooting in the dark. In this cycle of humanity this wisdom & and healing is lost on us. 

What does it do for you? 

1. Your life will show the results. 
2. Your soul will thank you for this.
3. The Universe will reward you for this. 
4. Your world will cherish you for this. 

This is what happened to me when Navel Consciousness showed up in my life. I began to channel it after receiving the Navel Awakwning Initiation from Mother Rabiya. 

This introduction can’t tell you everything. Like how you use Navel Consciousness in your life. Or if I am authentic or crystal clear or not.

Ltd.""™

A dynamic 23 years in media and films, where she worked for some of the biggest names in TV and the Indian Film Industry was interrupted by an unfortunate prolonged illness compounded by sheer medical negligence during 2005-2006, which got her temporarily immobilized waist downwards. Financially broke and living with her then 85 years old Father, she later sold her home to repay debts. Many other closures of her life, followed thereafter.
What stayed with her were implicit faith, fortitude, courage and determination to rise above it all. Interactions with two faith healers during her seeming illness and later an Angel book from a friend and the Charles Virtue Angel workshop in 2010, made Roshani more cognizant of the intervention of these powerful beings in human lives. Trusting her intuition despite financial obstacles, she quit her media dream job to embark on her spiritual journey to enthuse people unveil their own divine potential and recognize the same in others. Transformation followed and still continues with Roshani inspiring many lives across the Globe.

Roshani since the last 9 years of her own spiritual growth and journey has touched many lives. She is now an Approved Therapist and Training Provider by the IPHM, U.K. Roshani’s mission is to empower and inspire as many souls across the world to discover their true selves, their passions, their life purpose, their own divinity and that of others, and ultimately serve as a Universal Citizen by being the best version of who they can truly be, while igniting the inner Light of many along the way. Roshani's endeavor to ignite this latent potential within each person, is of prime importance and focus in all the work that she executes be it Individual or Corporate personal sessions in guidance and healing, mentoring, coaching or training. She aims to fuel that very power that can help each one, heal their own lives and be a living transformation to help others around them and eventually the world.

Starting a non working car on highway  or finding how particular product or person would be positive or not for my work/profession and so on.

2249,"Mita Bhan","Fall seven times. Stand up eight. – Japanese proverb

My journey of self discovery began in 1998s when I chose to turn inwards to find the answers about Life and Soul. The answers didn’t come instantly as I had hoped, but gradually revealed themselves with daily meditation, Reiki and my deck of Tarot cards. As I slowly understood the who’s, what’s and why’s of my Life with the help of my mentors and gurus and books, I began to assimilate  the visions, sensations, insights and emotions and make sense of the messages I received. And I learnt just what joy there was to be found in sharing inner knowledge with others.

A certified Tarot Master, Reiki Master (Level IIIA), a Crystal Medicine Therapist, Crystal Astrologer with a diploma in Counselling Psychology, I still feel I have something new to learn each day even after over a decade of practice. With every personal experience, and with every reading I do, a part of me learns a little more about the beauty of human souls and the universal truths.

My days are spent applying whatever I’ve learnt, from my Gurus and Mentors across India, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Germany, USA, China and UK.  I enjoy meditation, writing about my learnings and reading the energies reading the energies of people from over 22 countries worldwide from my office in DLF City, India.

I do not claim to know all the answers but I do know I have the ability to connect and read the energies of others, and help them find a little clarity and peace.

At the end of the day I believe we are all the masters of our own destiny and are responsible for our own life and actions. The only real teachers are life and yourself.
