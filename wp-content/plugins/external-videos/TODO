Media Gallery:
After WP 3.5, Media moved to backbone.js and media upload filters longer work.
-  To do: make extension of Media Explorer plugin (MEXP) to enable these features

- add to the shortcode for gallery the number of videos to show and potentially a tag
  to restrict the selected videos to.
- add a shortcode for categories filter, see http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-external-videos-a-way-to-have-multiple-galleries-based-on-categories?replies=8
- add a param for order of displayed posts, see http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-external-videos-is-there-an-easy-way-to-reverse-the-gallery-thumbnails?replies=4
